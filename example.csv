 If it's helpful, I could use one. I'm not limited on my account, so however it needs to work, but I have time today. We're good.
RedPen
 Okay. All right. Well, let's just go ahead and get started on this one and then we'll see how it goes. All right, so we're talking mostly about Aspire, but we're talking about landscaping crew tracking app, and then also the landscaping equipment management app. Let's talk about crew tracking first. Basically, explain to me what is a landscaping crew tracking app, but I know that you have CrewMobile, but tell me in general, what is it?
Jason Pyne
 Yeah, so a crew tracking app, generally, it's a mobile application, so it's designed for a phone, maybe a tablet, but the phone is going to be the most popular because that's the device that we can generally count on the crew having on their person when they're in the field. It's an application that does a few different things, so it facilitates communication from the main office or what we might call the back office, people who are managing the landscaping business and the people who are the crew, the folks who are doing the physical labor out in the field. It's communicating that by listing, it might be in crew level, we do a list of your scheduled tickets for that day or for this week or for next week. You can look at the work that has been set aside for you and your crew, if you're working with multiple people.
That that's where it starts is a simple list of here's where to go and generally what to do. There could be applications that have notifications or some two-way communication. CrewMobile has a piece of that. Other similar solutions do as well where the crew can communicate back to that back office or the management staff of, hey, I'm here now, either through GPS or there's some other signifier in their system that says they're working on ticket X or they're finished with ticket X and now they're starting ticket Y, that kind of a thing. They can talk about in transit time if they're using GPS and things of that nature. It allows in some cases real time communication between, again, the management and the actual production staff. There's some other finer grain things may be in there too, but I'm not sure how critical that is. Allocating materials to a given job, things like that, can often happen to those, but those are again, maybe a little bit further down.
RedPen
 Okay. Are there tiers or levels of crew tracking apps? I know that some provide you with more functionality, whereas other ones are just really basic. Can you address that a little bit as far as what the differences are?
Jason Pyne
 Yeah. I expect there are. I'm most familiar with ours at Aspire with CrewMobile, but I'm sure you could think of it in the way that we described it. The first level is just going to be here's a list of things to do so that your employee, the crew, they know what to do when they're independently working without direct supervision. I think that that middle tier would be where we start to get into realtime two-way communication, whether that is text-driven or email notification driven. Just ways instead of just a simple one-way list, we can now have a dialogue of sorts between management and crew. And then I think probably that third level and the way we treat it at Aspire would be going beyond that and integrating more. Yes, it's real time, but it's GPS enhanced, so they could involve GPS services or could just use location services on your phone if you're the crew member to communicate where you are or if you're in transit or maybe even being able to generate ad hoc work.
The crew, they're not just receiving work. They can actually document, hey, the property owner or manager came out and said we needed to do something that wasn't on our list. We had the time, but we want to account for it. We documented an ad hoc job so that we can account for it and bill them if necessary, things like that. I would progress from that first simple list to some basic two-way communication to that third GPS enhancement and or some ad hoc ability for the crew to actually not just be taking in information, but being able to document new job information.
RedPen
 Right, okay. And then the GPS capabilities, and that would be also being able to communicate that information to the customer. GPS, your tech is on the way, the tech has arrived or are those kinds of things. Is it that granular?
Jason Pyne
 Most of the ones I'm aware of today are not quite at that level, but you're absolutely right. That's a use case that some of our clients are talking about of man, wouldn't it be great if I could give them not just a window of a cable company, a famous example of, hey, between today and tomorrow we'll be there, but within a 30-minute window or maybe an hour or so, something that's pretty reasonably close in on what their actual arrival time might be. Again, I'm not sure that many are there today, but that's definitely of interest for the industry right now.
RedPen
 Mow, is Aspire doing the text notifications with customers?
Jason Pyne
 We just recently in the last several months have released a couple different kinds of notifications and then we have some more coming out. The ones we've released are to signify that work has started or it's already completed. What we're working on now is that forewarning communication of, hey, don't forget we're going to be at your property tomorrow. We're going to be there later today. That kind of a thing. That's definitely of mind for us.
RedPen
 Okay, good. All right. And then, okay, so small businesses versus large enterprise companies. I know that this article wants to focus on the large enterprise landscaping companies mostly, but as far as using the crew tracking app, do you see both sides of businesses using this and getting benefit from it?
Jason Pyne
 Absolutely. For us, CrewMobile, and again, I don't want to be too close in on just CrewMobile, but clients of all sizes for us use CrewMobile because it acts as that first layer, it's kind of like a time clock. It's how these small businesses are able to keep track of payroll information of here's the work that needs to get done, here's the hours that should track against that work. It's really a critical tool for that small, almost like from that owner operator position. We have very few of those on Aspire, but if you think about it, the owner operator is used to doing sales and then coming back the next day and doing the work. They're now starting to branch out. Maybe they got a couple of trucks running for the first time and they want to keep a tab on that new employee.
Hopefully, they trust them and everything, but they can trust and verify that things are taking place as they need to. Now, the kind of communication that's taking place there with a smaller business is likely going to be simpler because there's just not quite so much going on. It's going to be mostly that payroll function. There's probably not going to be a lot of route complexity, so it's truck one, truck two, and there might be some interchangeability because if hey, truck one broke down because it's my daily driver with 250,000 miles it, I need truck two to actually come and finish my route for the day because that's where the most important work was. That kind of stuff can happen.
I would say, and I'm going to going to cross into the equipment piece here because we do both in CrewMobile, but it's pretty unlikely for the smaller business to track assets or equipment because they probably don't have a whole lot. They've got a couple of trucks, they'll have a couple mowers. Anything larger like an excavator or a Caterpillar or things like that, they're probably going to rent. They're not really concerned about tracking depreciation or utilization hours because really, for them, it's just a direct cost. If I rented this for X number of dollars for today and that's what's going against this job, so there's probably not a huge component there for them. It's just simpler. The larger businesses, as you might expect, it's just much more complex. You've got in some cases dozens of routes and there's probably still some interchangeability, but now they're not all equal.
You've got some maintenance routes who are doing very standard services. They're just mowing and trimming and that's pretty much all they're doing. You might have a couple of irrigation techs who are not doing any mowing. They're strictly working on sprinkler systems and things of that nature. You'll have installation crews who are working with mulch and annual colors and trees and shrubs and things that they're actually installing as permanent installations on the property. They're all equipped very differently and the labor that's involved there might be interchangeable. The irrigation guys could probably mow just fine, but their skillset and the equipment that they have with them is really fine-tuned for irrigation or for installation. Your installation folks will have a lot of shovels, but they probably don't have a lot of mowers. Understanding how interchangeable, not just your labor pool is, but your equipment, and again, crossing into that topic, that becomes pretty different.
Now, base level, this larger business still needs to know what work was done, how much time it took per job per crew. There's a lot of that basic time clock stuff. That's still foundational, but you're moving beyond it just because you've got a business that's now at scale, multiple routes, specialized functions, a lot more equipment. To that end, you're much more likely to use our equipment module, which again, it fits into CrewMobile. Broadly in the industry, I think at least a couple of our competitors do very similar things where if you're a customer of this tier and above, you will have these extra options in your mobile app and you could keep track of equipment. For us, we have a couple of layers where they could submit requests of, hey, I just noticed that the tail light is out.
Probably got to get that fixed. We also have a separate module where you're actually logging inspections, so you've got a checklist of things that you have to make sure are in good shape mechanically or otherwise. That can be really, really important for law enforcement and DOT regulations and things like that. Something like that you really don't find at the lower end. I should also mention comparing the two in a similar vein, just like a larger business might have greater compliance requirements for equipment tracking and things of that nature, they're going to have the same issue with payroll. They're going to be held to a much higher standard on overtime and taking the correct number of breaks. You're going to see custom language that comes up in the enterprise scale application where it says, hey, you've been working for five hours, it's time to take a break.
Or when it's time to clock out, you have to attest that you've taken all the breaks that you need to, or you are [inaudible 00:11:11], actively thinking about it. I'm waiving my right to that break because I know I have a right, I'm just not doing it. You rarely see that kind of customization on the smaller level because again, it's very often an owner operator with a couple of other closely trusted folks. They understand they're really just going to track their time. They might not be doing the kind of specialized labor that requires some additional compliance like chemical applications and things of that nature. Levels of customization within the app that are not necessarily different tiers, but just how that app has been configured by that business going to be pretty different.
RedPen
 I'm glad I'm talking to you because I think I'm under the misperception that CrewMobile was for smaller businesses, businesses like $3 million and under, but you're talking about CrewMobile, being able to be used by commercial enterprise businesses. Is that just a different plan? Is CrewMobile available to all size businesses?
Jason Pyne
 Yes. All of our clients, and maybe there's a confusion around CrewControl.
RedPen
 Maybe that's it.
Jason Pyne
 Versus CrewMobile. CrewControl is our platform. It's a pretty simple platform. It's similar to Aspire. It helps you schedule things, but it's really designated or designed for businesses that are below about a million dollars. We find that below that threshold, you really don't get a lot of the benefit from the additional functionality and complexity that comes with Aspire and CrewControl does not have a mobile application themselves. Their app is pretty mobile friendly, but it's just a website.
RedPen
 Okay. We won't even talk about CrewControl.
Jason Pyne
 Yeah, CrewMobile is used by all Aspire clients across all of our tiers. Yep.
RedPen
 Okay. Thank you for clarifying that for me. All right, so pain points that companies experience with tracking their crews. Can you talk about that in general as far as what companies are telling you as far as what their problems are?
Jason Pyne
 Yeah, so starting with the simple stuff of how do I put the appropriate level of blinders or focus on my crew to make sure that, hey, I'm in crew A today, let me make sure I'm looking at crew A's assignments as opposed to getting distracted by, hey, what's crew B up to? We mentioned the interchangeability. That can be a really strong point for that smaller business of like, hey, A and B, they're fully interchangeable. When you get to that larger business, there's a pain point of I really got to lock this down so that crew A doesn't get distracted, but that means I lose some of the interchangeability. That puts a little bit more burden on the management team. If something does come up with crew A and we do need to replace them somehow, there's appropriate levels of communication in the field. That happens both through CrewMobile and they're also doing it the old fashioned way through texts and phone calls directly out to the crew to make sure that they can make the appropriate adjustments.
Another pain point would be offline capability, and this is something that we're working on actively at Aspire because our clients are telling us, hey, we're doing work pretty often at places where we don't have reliable cell phone access or cell phone network coverage and our app and most other apps are really driven on active internet connection. If you don't have it, it puts you in a tough spot for recording all the essential information that CrewMobile is getting today, like payroll, like material allocation like, hey, we finished this job but we need to come back tomorrow because the other one is only 70% done if they had a couple of different things to do at the site. Creating an offline capable application is something that we're actively engaged in. Very few others, I can only think of one other in the landscape industry, publicly touts offline capability right now. That that's a big focus for us.
Let's see. We've made some recent additions to include the equipment pieces. That's been a focus where the crew is operating, yes, the truck, but they also have other assets like mowers or excavators and the certainly have a trailer to keep all that stuff with them. We need to document the vehicle and other assets' conditions. Much more common, as I said, at the larger enterprise because they might be crossing state lines and have DOT regulations, they might have to check in at weigh stations and prove that they performed a morning inspection before they hit the road, that kind of a thing. We're adding that. I would say that that is an edge on most of our competitors that might have some capability for custom forms, but not a dedicated vehicle inspection or what they call it digital vehicle inspection report. I try to make some notes, that's why I'm looking away and in fact, I'll share these with you in case they're helpful. It's just a PowerPoint deck.
RedPen
 Oh yeah, please do.
Jason Pyne
 The pain point we hit with the small business is they're just starting off scaling. They probably only have a few crews and that owner is probably still closely involved in sales and operations. The reason they adopted Aspire or were they adopted any app is because they're growing to a point where they can no longer either manage everything themselves to a level of satisfaction or they can no longer organize all that and trust that it's going to be carried out. It's a way for them to facilitate key communication, again, out to the crew and ideally, back to themselves as the owners or whatever management [inaudible 00:16:57] is handling that. Those are some of the key ones.
We have a few feature requests that are born out of pain. I mentioned the offline piece. Use of barcode scanning and QR code scanning is something that's bubbling for us as a feature request, and that comes from both the materials world. Hey, I want to scan a code rather than pick something from a dropdown to allocate salt that I just put down for this snow event or fertilizer that I put down for the planting or the maintenance that I just did. Same deal with mulch or any other material, gravel, that kind of thing. Basically allowing people to more accurately choose the material that's being allocated and then they can input their amount. Since today, they're pulling that out of a dropdown and it's always possible for human error if I picked the wrong thing out of a dropdown on a mobile phone.
RedPen
 The QR code would actually scan the barcode on the materials, but it wouldn't tell you how much was used. They would still have to put that in there.
Jason Pyne
 Right. It would automatically select that material type and allow them to be like, okay, I'm using the right code for mulch or the right code for this salt as opposed to the other thing. Actually for larger clients, because they have more complicated item catalogs or inventory catalogs, that's actually a bigger problem for them because that dropdown now instead of having a handful of items, has dozens. To scroll through that can be difficult at times. Scanning is a way to get around that. A similar use case for, we talked about vehicle tracking. If I could put a QR code instead of having to very closely scrutinize the VIN number or some other unique identifier for the mower or whatever happens to be, that will really speed up. I'm looking at the correct piece of equipment, I could document any maintenance that is required or I can complete this inspection that's required of me before I start my day. Standing functionality is just a way to do that a little bit more quickly and with a greater level of certainty.
RedPen
 Okay, I gotcha. All right. As far as what are some of the crew tracking solutions people are using today? We're talking about apps, I know that. Are they using apps mostly or are they just doing it? What are you finding as in the field as far as what crews are doing? How are they tracking their crews?
Jason Pyne
 Yeah. Most who come to us, they're accustomed to some other software programs, so they might have been using Boss LM or LMN or Asset and all of those platforms, they have a mobile app of sorts where they're able to track some of this basic information. That's the most common. We view ourselves as a step up from some of those other platforms in the functionality that we offer as a whole. Most folks are really generally available, or sorry, not available. They're really looking for and generally looking toward that kind of information coming from a mobile application. For those who haven't come to that spot yet, like some folks are transitioning from paper records and so they're happy just to go to a text or an email system where the employee texts their boss when they get to the job and they text them when they leave.
There's a timestamp on both of those. You do some math and you come out at a payroll estimation. Some are doing, let's see. I'm not aware of a lot of standalone time clock apps, but they might be using a Kronos or things of that nature where you can use GPS features of those apps, but they're really just time focused. They're not specific to the work. They don't have a great system for capturing materials or certain equipment depreciation that's taking place. Utilization more so than depreciation. But I think QuickBooks, did they buy TSheets? A very similar time-focused application. You see those mostly at the, I would say the smaller end, folks who haven't embraced a system like LMN or Boss or Asset. They're not used to a formal landscaping-specific or industry-specific application.
For those who have, again, number one, they're looking for it, they make sure in the sales process that we do have that sort of capability for their crews. And then they also want to understand how simple is it? The beauty of these time clock apps is they're really, really simple. You clock in and you clock out and basically, you allow all the app to read GPS data or not. That's the whole of it. With these business management systems that are vertically focused for landscaping, you've got more and more is potentially much better because you can track exactly what job gets this work, exactly what job gets these materials. But that means the crew has to understand and interact with that app, which sometimes can be a challenge because that's not their primary job.
Their primary job is to do valuable but also physically grueling work and they want to get on with it and not be held up tapping the phone. Occasionally, there's language barriers and we've got to find ways to help them overcome that. We also need to provide the right resources for those crews to understand the app, both by training the system administrators and they in turn train their own staff, but we also need to provide to help to the end user, to the crew folks to make sure that they understand how to use the app and can do so without problems in the field.
RedPen
 The companies need to know this information because they need to understand what their productivity is as far as progress on the jobs and how long it's taken them and if their techs are not performing at a certain level and bonuses and all of those things. Okay. One of the things I wanted to ask you before I forget is the pricing for not CrewControl, but CrewMobile app and tracking that and everything, but can they use that app? I'm not sure about this answer, but are they able to find price book information through the app with Aspire or not? Pricing out landscaping jobs, can they do an estimate?
Jason Pyne
 Gotcha. Not in our CrewMobile app. We do have a mobile friendly web app or a part of the Aspire platform in general that helps what we call estimators access that information and price out those kinds of jobs. Generally, we find that our users, their crews are not in charge of that. They're there to actually perform the work and they have a separate Salesforce. Now, that's something that you would find differently for a very small organization where again, the owner is both sales and operations and so the great ones, they will know your yard and then they'll knock on your neighbor's door before they drive off and say, hey, I just mowed his, how about we come back next week and do yours as well? Here's the price. Documenting that is key, especially for those small operators. Again, not something that we often see in CrewMobile specifically.
RedPen
 Well, I saw something, I've got a list of features from Aspire and one of them said something about, like you were talking about before, allowing the reporting of issues from the field or the creation of quick tickets for situations requiring quick action. I didn't know if there was a way to do that.
Jason Pyne
 Yeah. In CrewMobile, that's that ad hoc work of, hey, the property owner manager came out and said we got a busted irrigation head that's leaking, whatever it is. That's not part of their work for that day. They need to be able to track both the time and then materials that go against it. We do allow what we call quick tickets or ad hoc work to document, again, time and materials against that kind of action.
RedPen
 Okay, gotcha. All right. Last question. How does Aspire Landscaping crew tracking app work exactly, and how is it better than those? Because you've talked about it a lot during our conversation, but in general, what would be your bullet points as far as why Aspire crew tracking is better?
Jason Pyne
 Yeah, well, it's part of the Aspire platform, so it's one app. You don't have to worry about integration because it's part of the platform itself. That may or may not be true if you're using some Lucy goosey time tracking app versus your main business management software. It's integral to the Aspire system. That's number one. It does that basic time clock function, which is great and it's necessary. It ties into GPS automatically, so there's no need to wonder if Jason clocked in within the approved geofence. That's part of Jason's time entry that day, so that's great. Like we talked about, it gives you a list of scheduled tickets or scheduled work for my route. I can configure it so I can view multiple routes if I'm a really interchangeable person or I can be very laser focused on just my assignments for that day.
We just talked about the ad hoc ability. For those things that come up, those are often profitable things because they weren't baked into the schedule. It's just potentially extra revenue and definitely helps with the client relationship. They were on this site and they were able to do the work today. Or even if they couldn't complete that job, they could document it with significant detail, pictures, et cetera, and get that on the schedule for next visit or next day. Specifically that ad hoc piece we find is a big advantage.
RedPen
 Define the problem and you solve it right away. That's a pretty big deal.
Jason Pyne
 It makes perfect sense, but interestingly, if the crew doesn't know they have that tool, sometimes they assume that they don't. Again, we want to keep their job simple so that they can do the great job that we need them to do in the field, but giving them the right tool is key in every industry I've worked in.
But landscaping, you've got tools maybe to even a greater degree. We talked about material allocation as well. We talked about mulch or salt or rocks or plant installations. Having that, again, within one platform where I'm in ticket ABC and I can attribute my time towards that ticket, which is my primary cost driver in landscaping, my materials, which is my secondary cost driver in landscaping, and then I can also document my equipment utilization, which is probably my third-largest cost driver, all within a single platform. It's not the crew that has to make the decision of how much did we put in? What's that really cost? That's all tied in to the price catalog that the enterprise client or the small client has set up. It's all unique to them. We talked about custom forms as well. This is an area of flexibility that not all of our competitors offer.
Whether it's compliance language around taking the right number of breaks or affirming that yes, you had all the right training for the day, that you had the correct PPE, that your equipment is in good working order. Our clients use our custom forms in too many ways to enumerate, frankly, and that's what they're for, because our clients, they often do very similar work, but they operate in surprisingly different ways and the information that they have to gather for their operation differs significantly as well. Customer issues. Those are very versatile. We talked about the ad hoc work, but customer issues are a little bit different. That's more documenting a complaint, not necessarily an urgent piece of work I have to do today, but taking on an issue and maybe making that into a sales opportunity of, hey, the property manager mentioned some standing water, or they mentioned this shrub on the other side, or whatever it happens to be.
They can gather that information. It doesn't have to be related to work or labor that we're doing that day, but we can capture it. And then again, tying back into the equipment piece, which we have integral in CrewMobile, having that in one spot where the crew who's interacting with all that equipment can readily submit maintenance requests and or submit inspections, really is a step forward. We find that the DVIR or the inspection piece, we just released it last month, this is really a big step forward. We've seen surprisingly high utilization already, and we haven't aggressively marketed it, but we've got about a hundred of our clients looking at it like, man, we needed this. We didn't even know it. All of a sudden, it showed up and great, we're going to document our vehicles. We're going to inform our maintenance staff so that we can take better care of our second-largest investment in the business, which is equipment, behind only labor.
RedPen
 You call that a DVIR?
Jason Pyne
 DVIR, digital vehicle inspection report.
RedPen
 Okay. People are accessing that and they're using that. The biggest thing with that is getting your return on your investment on your equipment and knowing when to replace it, when it's going to break down before it breaks down and those kinds of things. It's really important, especially for large enterprise companies.
Jason Pyne
 Yeah, because they typically own their equipment and so they're tracking depreciation from the accounting side, but they also need to know what does the preventive maintenance schedule look like? I would say the other side of that is compliance-oriented. If they were to get pulled over, especially across state lines, and we have clients that operate on the border, and so state lines are all they deal with. Sometimes they need to show law enforcement that they in fact did perform an inspection and that they ensured that that vehicle is in safe working order.
Even if there's a problem, if they were speeding, if they can show that, hey, we ensure that this was safe and here's the record of it, it's digital so you can access it on the fly, that can prevent much larger penalties to the enterprise themselves. We haven't aggressively marketed that. It's only been out for just over a month and we've seen much higher usage. I thought we'd see one or two dozen companies dip their toe, but we've had, again, close to a hundred in just over the Christmas break essentially explore that feature and we've got some great feedback about where we need to go next with that, too. Very exciting.
RedPen
 Nice. All right, so I think we, you've covered a lot of the landscaping equipment stuff, but just let's just go over it really quick. The landscaping equipment management app is basically just to manage the equipment that you have with your company, make sure it stays in working order, you know when to replace it and you know what it's going to cost. What else do you need to know about as far as the equipment app?
Jason Pyne
 Yeah. On a basic level, and this is where we've been for a while, is what's broken? Just a simple issue collection system. The inspections piece we just talked about is a little bit more preventative and has that compliance piece, but the crew has long been able to submit or request of, hey, this belt is broken, or the headlights aren't working, or whatever happens to be. That simple stuff really just empowers the maintenance organization, the folks who are changing oil and changing belts and sharpening blades. It sounds mundane, but that's how the crew gets their work done. They need to have equipment that works and when there's a problem, document it immediately so it can be solved as quick as possible. Again, that's mostly in the larger realm where they own their equipment and they're doing a lot of in-house maintenance, but even when they're outsourcing their maintenance, they need to know what needs to be done so that they can talk to their maintenance partners and figure out what the right schedule is for that work to be done.
RedPen
 How often do you think inspections need to be done as far as the equipment goes? Is it a daily, weekly, monthly rotation? How does that work?
Jason Pyne
 Yeah, I'd say that generally varies by the kind of equipment. If it's a motor vehicle, a truck or something like that, it very well might be a daily inspection because that's what the law enforcement entities would be most interested in. Assuming most of the other equipment is just on a trailer behind that truck, they probably don't care. That's more of the internal cost tracking for the business to keep track of, and that's probably more of a weekly or most likely a monthly inspection for those kinds of assets.
RedPen
 Would you say the pain points for these contractors are that their technicians or the people who are driving their equipment or using their equipment are not reporting on a regular basis or not reporting it accurately or something? What's the pain point for this?
Jason Pyne
 Yeah, I think one pain point is utilization, because engine hours is really what counts on a mower and equipment of a similar size because you might be at the job site for four hours, but you probably only used that mower for two and a half or three because you were doing other things with other pieces of equipment at times. Understanding what the utilization rate was is a big cost driver. It's also a huge maintenance driver. Instead of mileage that we typically track on a vehicle, we're looking at engine hours for those things. And then it sounds super basic, but just the location. Where is this piece of equipment? A lot of this stuff does come back to a central yard or office or whatever where they keep it in a garage or it's locked behind a gate or something like that. But there's still a lot of businesses that are fully remote.
Having a mobile capability to understand, okay, the truck is with Jason or the mower is with Jason, it's Jason's liability if something happens to it. If he parked it out in the street and somebody bumped into it or heaven forbid, stole it, these things happen. Knowing where it was. When it comes to actual GPS tracking, which is not part of what Aspire, we offer firsthand, but we do partner with GPS services, we call it our integrated telematics solutions, you can actually, if the vehicle or the asset is stolen, they can track that because it's separate from the vehicle itself. It's its own little plug-in tracker. They could potentially recover those assets or certainly prove on an insurance claim that that thing was stolen and no longer in their control or possession. Again, maybe not part of Aspire proper, but a key partnership that we have a couple of different providers that offer that service to our clients is a big deal.
I guess that last point is really how do we empower fully remote workforces? Because we know that landscapers are generally distributed in their workforce, but most commonly, they're meeting at a central location. They might call it the yard or whatever it happens to be, or they will form up in their cruise, they'll load their truck and trailer and they'll get going for the day. But a lot of them, again, they're still fully remote. People are self-reporting to the job site. I don't go to an office, I go from my house to where I'm going to work that day, and you really can't do that safely or with a lot of confidence unless you have some remote tracking capabilities through an app or through a GPS service like we talked about. That'd be pretty key for, again, probably if you're counting labor and materials, labor and equipment, those are your top two and three cost drivers in the landscaping business.
RedPen
 Absolutely. That's also about knowing what these things cost and budgeting and preparing for the future and if you want to grow, what it's going to cost you to do that. There's a lot of financial information related to all this.
Jason Pyne
 I would say that's an underrated aspect here of, okay, I need to run another crew, which means another truck, which means another mower, which means two more trimmers. A lot of our smaller operators, they're just coming to grips with those kinds of decisions, so they need data to show them and they need to be maybe forcefully reminded of, here's what it costs, and that truck, you're probably only going to keep for five or seven years, and trucks are famously not cheap and they're even less cheap over the last few years. That's a huge driver and that's really Aspire's overall value prop is that we expose information to these owners and operators in real time that they may not have access to at all through other systems or certainly not in a real time, and so we want them to make great decisions to grow.
Transparently, we do better when they do better, but we also want them to have data. We want to make a difference in their life. For the crew, hey, get paid for the time you spend working. Clock in. Get credit for the work you did. Attribute that to a job. Avoid liabilities when it comes to vehicle maintenance, equipment maintenance, GPS tracking helps make sure that you were where you said you were, just avoiding issues like that. And then for the management and ownership layer, giving them data around costs, giving them data around performance and quality so that they can all come together and achieve the best outcomes for their business and for their clients.
RedPen
 Perfect. Well, Jason, you've been a wonderful interview. You've covered a lot of bases here. I think we're almost out of time, about less than a minute now, but I think I've got what I need. If you would be willing to share that PowerPoint with me, I can take a look at that and then take a look at this interview and then I can share my article with you once it's done.
Jason Pyne
 Yeah, absolutely.
RedPen
  Get your sign off. Okay, great.
Jason Pyne
 That's great.
RedPen
 All right, well, I'm going to stop the interview before they kick me off, and I will talk to you soon.
Jason Pyne
 Thank you, Diana. Good to meet you.
RedPen
 Thank you, Jason. You too.
Jason Pyne
 Bye now.
RedPen
 Bye.

 Well numbers is what we're talking about. So I think you'll be good. So let's go ahead and get started. So what we're talking about today is the accounting apps for landscapers.
And so what they want to talk about, or if you're a company and you're choosing an accounting app, what kinds of things do you look for? So we'll want to talk about the features, the pricing considerations, integrations, usability, security compliance, those kinds of things.
Catherine
 That's also hard for me to talk about because I mean, I like reporting. I look at the reporting. So if I go up, I want to see if I have any ... I would say inventory, but Aspire has inventory. So we don't need that anymore. Payroll, if they're not doing payroll in QuickBooks, they're using offsite payroll service, they don't need that anymore.
And so if I'm looking for, people ask me all the time, ""Which do I like the best?"" Well, for small companies, I like QuickBooks Desktop, but we kind of push more, and QuickBooks is trying to get away from Desktop. So people that are just really small and don't need a lot of reporting, QuickBooks online works. If they're getting bigger, bigger and need better reporting, then it would be. Or if they have more than one company or they have tons of branches, they would want Acumatica.
It's just the level. QuickBooks Desktop, QuickBooks Online is for smaller, less reporting. And then Acumatica is when you start getting bigger.
Speaker 1
 Okay. So the larger enterprise companies might be more interested in integrating with something like that?
Catherine
 Yeah.
Speaker 1
 Okay.
Catherine
 And that's integrated. We integrate easy, and it's not easy, but easier is QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Desktop, and Acumatica.
Speaker 1
 And those are the ones that Aspire integrates with, right?
Catherine
 Correct.
Speaker 1
 Okay. All right.
Catherine
 The others, we do have others, but they have to have a bridge. It's a lot more complicated.
Speaker 1
 Okay. So as far as the features themselves, as far as the accounting app, and we can talk about Aspire of course, but as far as just in general, what are the kinds of features that you're looking for beyond this reporting? I mean?
Catherine
 Reporting, just reporting. What kind of reports? Do they have budgets? Can we compare budget to actual? It's just the reporting needs of a company on the accounting side. Because everything else on production is in Aspire. They don't need job costing anymore, inventory anymore. They don't need a lot of that stuff.
It depends on the company. I mean maybe some people do have inventory that they can't put in Aspire. But most of the time everything sales tax, everything's in Aspire. So they don't need tons anymore. It's just the kind of reports. Do they want to look at it per division? How detailed do they want those reports?
That's why it's kind of hard for me to say because without knowing a company. Some people just are balance sheet, PNL, that's it. Because that's all it is, is the balance sheet and the profit and loss, all the details are in Aspire. So do I want it per branch? Do I want it per company? Do I want it for actual versus budget? Per branch, per division?
It depends on how deep they want the reporting. And I think QuickBooks Desktop on a lower level, gives the best, better than QuickBooks online. But QuickBooks Desktop is really trying to go away and get everybody on QuickBooks Online.
Speaker 1
 Oh, okay. I gotcha. So as far as the features you were just talking about, so the inventory. So if you don't have an Aspire app and you don't have software, I mean you're looking for an accounting assist basically for your landscaping company. So you're saying that you could basically include your inventory, your purchasing, your job costing, your invoicing, estimating, all of those things, right?
Catherine
 Correct. You can do that somewhat in QuickBooks. Yeah, it's not a higher level. That's why everybody moves to a system like Aspire or LMN or Service Autopilot. QuickBooks doesn't have scheduling. They do have you mobile, you can clock in on mobile.
We're earned revenue. You can't really find that an accounting system that doesn't earned revenue versus invoice. And so people will get to the point QuickBooks isn't big enough, it's usually QuickBooks, Whiteboards for scheduling, and Excel. And people are like, ""I'm just so tired of this. I want one system that I can do estimating, scheduling, everything."" And that's what Aspire is. Now people would love Aspire to be an accounting system also, but that's never going to happen.
Speaker 1
 Right. But they're looking for something where they don't have to go to five different platforms to figure out what's going on. I mean, they need a-
Catherine
 Correct.
Speaker 1
 One-stop shop. Okay. So let's talk about pricing a little bit. I know that, and this is another differentiator for Aspire, I think, is that you don't charge by seat, right? Don't you charge a-
Catherine
 Aspire?
Speaker 1
 Yeah, Aspire, don't they charge like a flat rate fee for whatever corporate?
Catherine
 I think it's a percentage of revenue.
Speaker 1
 Yeah. And a lot of these apps charged by seat. So you can really rack up the cost when you're-
Catherine
 Yeah, QuickBooks Desktop online media version, the 2023 because we sync and now they're upgrading Windows to 11 and QuickBooks 2023, and they're not syncing from Aspire. There's something that just isn't working. Well, I can't tell. I'm an outside person. I need somebody inside the box for Aspire to look at it. So I need to get QuickBooks on there.
And I looked it up and it was like 799 for one person a year I think. I think. And then 500 for each additional seat as you're calling it, users is what they call it. So if I had five people, I mean that's like 2000, $2800 a year if it's per year. And I think QuickBooks online does it monthly or annually. It's a service. QuickBooks desktop, you bought it and if you didn't need any of the upgrades and you were okay with it, you never had to buy it again. Well they're starting to do that annual thing too, I think.
And so you can get pricey. I mean, especially if you have payroll. I know the higher version of the QuickBooks can be up to three, 3500 a year with unlimited users. So there is a max. But yeah, it just keeps. Like now, I notice I got to reach out to my boss. I think QuickBooks Online is wanting like 30, $40 a month for what we would need. And I'm like-
Speaker 1
 Per seat?
Catherine
 Yeah. Oh yeah, I think it is. I'd have to look at it again. But it was getting expensive. And I'm like, ""God, I hate to ask for that."" And we're just playing in it. We're just trying to learn it. We're not using it, so to speak, because we're not a landscape company. We're just doing it for testing and stuff.
Speaker 1
 You're just trying to integrate it with Aspire, so it's easily accessible for our landscapers, right? I mean-
Catherine
 Well, we want to be able to test it and play with it and understand it and learn it when people have questions. And I've got a new accounting lady, so I want to get her on QuickBooks online and let her be the QuickBooks Online Pro so we can go to her and ask her questions. Because I don't have access to QuickBooks online, none of us do.
We have access to QuickBooks Desktop because I gave everybody mine back when you could pay a one-time fee and that's all you needed. Now all of a sudden we've got sync issues. So it's getting more and more, everything's getting expensive. Ridiculous. I don't know how people are going to do it.
But I don't have kids anymore. But I can't even imagine what it would be like to have kids in this economy. Just can't imagine and trying to run a business. It's just crazy how expensive everything is.
Speaker 1
 Absolutely. And other thing I think with Aspire is that you have the API, which is what is that? Application programming interface?
Catherine
 My understanding is just a window we give them to be able to access our data. So we give them the API. So if they want to use the system that we don't sync with, that just opens the gate up where that company can come in and pull data into whatever and make it look like they want.
Because we don't sync with, say Sage as an accounting system. We don't sync with Sage. And so they have to have the API to get things to sync over. NetSuite's another one we don't. My heater, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1
 That's okay.
Catherine
 Want to turn it off. And NetSuite's another one. We have some clients that use NetSuite and they have to do the API.
Speaker 1
 Gotcha. Okay.
Catherine
 Or Bridge, I guess they call it. Build a bridge.
Speaker 1
 And so what about usability as far as this app? I mean, do you find the Aspire app and your integration with QuickBooks and Acumatica makes it easier to use? Or what would you say?
Catherine
 No, it's different. It's not hard. It's just different. They've got to open their mind up and it's not going to work the same way they're used to. Most small companies are used to QuickBooks, Whiteboards, and Excel, right? Well now they've got Aspire. It is a very robust, complicated system. They've got to open their mind up.
And I'm an accountant and I've been accountant forever, so my mind is very rigid. And I find that some people are just stuck in their ways. And trying to get them to open their mind up and clear their mind and just start all over and say, ""Okay, I'm open. Just tell me how to do it. Tell me what to do,"" and just do it instead of fighting it.
A lot of people will fight it because it's different than what they're used to. It's not hard, it's just different. You have to just break your old habits and say, kind of like moving from the United States to France. Their culture's different. You just got to understand, speak their language. It's just a whole different environment. And if you fight it, you're going to be miserable.
If you go in and realize, ""Oh, I'm in France. I got to learn the language, I got to learn how they do things, what they eat. I got to open myself up to it."" You'll enjoy yourself, but just understand it's different, if that makes sense.
Speaker 1
 Yeah, absolutely makes sense. And I think that the benefits of it, I mean once you do open your mind and see some of the benefits of it, then you can embrace that and it'll just make your business better.
What about security? As far as I know that security and compliance are the next two topics. So basically you need to keep your financials secure. You don't want to be sharing that information with people that don't need to know.
Catherine
 Yeah, I don't know the security. I'm sure Aspire is secure, I don't know. I can't answer that one on any of the scopes though. You think something's secure and then you get an email, ""Your bank was hacked and they stole all your information."" So I don't know as far as that goes.
Speaker 1
 As an accountant, what do you look for with security features in general?
Catherine
 Oh gosh. I mean, even on my own computer, that nobody can hack into my emails. Or what can I do? Just that not just everybody has access. We do lock, have roles in Aspire. QuickBooks has roles where you can't access certain things, but you can't lock people out of everything. You open this window up, well they're going to have 20 things they can access. And you're like, ""Well I really don't want them to have access to these five, I only want them to see this 15."" Well, we can't get that granular.
From a accounting perspective, it'd be nice to lock people out of things you don't want them to see. But other than that, I don't know what else to say, other than depends on the person's role I guess, and what you want them to have access to. But the main thing for me is that somebody can't hack into my system. That's so important to me.
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I think I talked to some other contractors and I think that some of them set it up so that they had the same person issuing checks and signing them. And that just creates all kinds of problems. I mean, you shouldn't do that.
Catherine
 Yeah. If you go through an audit like a GAAP, general executive accounting principal audit. I tell people if you take inventory once a month, that person shouldn't be the one making the quantity adjustments in the system. Yeah, I see what you're saying. That kind of security checks and balances.
Yeah. So you definitely don't want somebody that may be ordering the materials, entering the cost, and I don't know. You just want some kind of control over everything at a higher level. Yeah, definitely. But I see what you're saying-
Speaker 1
 Just got to have some-
Catherine
 [inaudible 00:12:14]. Yeah.
Speaker 1
 Some checks and balances on everything basically. I mean, you can't have-
Catherine
 Yeah, I'm a very checks and balance person. I know the company, landscape company I worked with before I went to Aspire, he hired me. I was his accountant for like nine years or seven years. He hired me to come in and restructure.
Once we started restructuring, putting that kind of in place, we caught people stealing. But you want to get your bank statement and lock everybody out. Maybe one person, maybe the owner, reviews the bank statement. So I see what you're saying. Yeah, it's just checks and balances. But I don't know specifically what I would say right at the moment.
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I think even equipment. I mean you got landscapers, they're using all kinds of big expensive equipment and they got to keep track of that and can't let people steal that and take it off the site or whatever. Okay.
Catherine
 Yeah, we just put our thing in cages because people would take stuff. We lock it
Speaker 1
 For sure. All right. And then compliance, I mean I'm not really sure how this relates to ... I mean I know that an accountant, there's certain procedures you have to follow. But in compliance, what comes to mind for you as far as what people need to be compliant?
Catherine
 Well in compliance, I guess it depends. I mean we're not GAAP, we have a few companies that are general accepted accounting principles, but most of it's tax laws, you want to be sure that when you file your taxes, your inventory is correct. Sales tax is huge. Making sure your sales tax is correct, your payroll is correct.
I mean for me, in compliance would be, I guess that you're ... I don't know if you're talking Aspire accounting in general, that you're doing everything within the guidelines with the government so you don't get in trouble with the government. That's the biggest thing. I mean obviously if the government was never involved, and I was doing the accounting, I'd want the books to be correct. So the owner knows if we're making money or not, that somebody's not stealing. That's the other checks and balances you're talking about that people aren't stealing, is the biggest one.
But as far as compliance, it's just making sure. I used to do credit card processing. My daughter talked me into do it years ago and she and I did it. And they have a lot of what they call PCI compliance, making sure you give somebody your credit card that somebody can't steal it. That's compliance.
So for me, I guess it's legally that's more the legal end of it, to where you're doing your sales tax correctly, you're doing your payroll correctly, you're doing your inventory correctly, so that you wouldn't go to jail down the road like Enron. Is that who it was? That was bumping up their balance sheet and fluffing it?
Speaker 1
 Yeah.
Catherine
 Yeah.
Speaker 1
 The other thing too that I just thought about, was that ... And it just went out of my head. Shoot. I can't remember what I was going to say as far as compliance goes.
Catherine
 We were talking about credit cards and-
Speaker 1
 Credit cards. So that's what it was. So basically if you have recurring services for your landscapers and you're sending them service agreements to come out and visit their property several times a year, I mean you're probably taking their credit card information. And so you need to have a secure system to be able to process that and do it. You can even do it on site with your mobile app.
Catherine
 Right.
Speaker 1
 So that's another big consideration. Okay. Well I think the overall thing is that basically I think an accounting app will help you eliminate your inefficiencies and your inaccuracies, and make things more efficient and more accurate in your reporting and all of that.
So with the last thing, part of this article is about key considerations. If you're out there looking for an accounting app, what do you need to consider? And the three things they want to talk about are business needs, accounting knowledge, and your budget. So as far as your business needs, can you address that as far as if you're just a small company?
Catherine
 Well, like I said, reporting. I mean, if they're not using Aspire, they'd want to say ... I used to actually years ago, get a wishlist. What is it you're looking for? And then I would create a wishlist for people and I'd say, ""Okay, I want your wishlist and what you're looking for in an accounting system."" Because the companies are growing, they wanted a bigger robust system.
And so I would take the wishlist and then I would go and look at this system and this system and this system. And I'd come back and say, ""Okay, the top 10 of your list is on this one. The bottom 10's on this one, the middle 10's on this one. What are you willing to give up? Because you're going to have to give up something.""
Like Aspire, they're used to using one accounting system for everything. And so now they're with Aspire. Aspire's a production system. We're not the accounting system. So now I had a used car dealership, heavy equipment, I've had all these industries where it was a different system. Well now you've got to merge the two. That's the opening of the mind and knowing, ""Okay, I'm going to have to do this differently than what I'm used to.""
So it's more of make your wishlist, what you want, and then research what it is you're looking at, what they will offer you on your wishlist, and then find whichever one meets the most on your list, if that makes sense.
Speaker 1
 It does, it does. And then as far as accounting knowledge, I mean you really need to understand. You're an accountant and you've been doing this for many, many years, but there may be companies that have no accounting experience whatsoever and they're trying to, but-
Catherine
 It's funny because I would like to say bigger companies need somebody with accounting experience for sure. But honestly, sometimes we, us accountants, are very difficult to deal with because we're stuck in our ways and we will fight it tooth and nail because we think it's not right. Well it's not that it's not right. It's just different than what we're used to.
I met with a lady yesterday I've been working with for years and she's the owner of the company. She's the wife of the owner and she's amazing. She has no accounting background. So it just depends on if your mind's open and you're willing to follow procedures. It's great to have accounting background if you can open your mind up. Or just be able to follow procedures and come up with standard operating procedures and that's what you're going to do and that's how you're going to do it.
I had one lady that she was doing everything. And she was in tears one day and I said, ""Well what do you do when you're gone? Do you ever sleep? Do you ever take time off?"" I said, ""You need to type up procedures so somebody can come in behind you."" And that's the main thing, is just having procedures and teaching people how to do it and maybe overseeing them.
Because the bigger you get, you can't do it at all. And I don't know that you have to have an accounting background, you just have to have an open mind. Does that make sense?
Speaker 1
 Yeah, it does. Absolutely. Okay. And then also the budget part of it. I mean Aspire, we're not going to get into what Aspire costs or anything like that. But you have to create a budget for your apps, right? I mean yo you have to know what you're willing to spend, like you said.
Catherine
 Yeah.
Speaker 1
 And go ahead.
Catherine
 I guess it's like, I guess a car. I can't afford an $80,000 car. I guess it depends on what you're looking for and what you want. I know a lot of people will get frustrated with Aspire and I've learned to say, ""Well why did you come to expire? There's got to be a reason you weren't happy with your other system."" Yeah, it was cheaper. And everything has got to make up for itself.
It's like one client I was talking to, he's new, he's fine with the Aspire now, but he was frustrated months ago because he said it's like learning anything. And he said he's working with a lot of big companies and they were four million a couple years ago, now they're eight million. And they say it's because of Aspire.
I mean you've got to have a reason for using the system, any system that costs money, and justifying it. And there's a reason you're changing, what are those reasons? And you've got to, like I said, make changes, own it, step back, and know you've got to change the way you do things. And if you want to grow, you've got to spend money to make money, isn't that the saying?
I mean unfortunately you can't keep using QuickBooks, Whiteboards, and Excel. You've got to go to the next level, which is a production software, which is Aspire. And you've got to embrace it and open it up and open your mind up. The biggest thing I have seen is making sure the person that's buying it, the owner, is going to enforce it and say, ""We're going with this system 100%. We're not playing around. You're either on board or you're not."" And I know that's hard today because it's hard to find work.
It's amazing to me. I go see all these signs hiring, hiring, short of help, be patient with us. And I see somebody on the street corner wanting money. That just baffles me.
Speaker 1
 I know.
Catherine
 So it's hard for me to say, have an attitude, ""That if you don't embrace Aspire, we're going to let you go."" Because good luck trying to replace them, right? So that's really hard to say. But they really do have to embrace it and own it and this is what we're going to do. It's like sending your kids to school kicking and screaming. Sorry.
Speaker 1
 You're going.
Catherine
 You got to make good grades and you're going whether you like it or not.
Speaker 1
 For sure. So as far as the way you were saying before, as far as that contractor you were talking about being frustrated with Aspire. What was his pain points, do you think?
Catherine
 It's just learning it. I mean it's different. The wording's different. Everything's different. Like I said, I keep using the word going to France, going to cooking school in France. We go to Europe every year, my daughter goes for about a month. And she takes her kids. And my granddaughter's 15, she just went to Europe, France, to study abroad for a month, stayed with a family.
And that girl came back, and the girl speaks really, her name's Caroline, she speaks amazing English, which is fascinating to me. You'd never know she's from France because she's been speaking it. But I noticed when a siren went by, I was like, ""I bet that sounds different."" And she goes, ""Yeah, the words are different."" She'd never been to [inaudible 00:22:05], she'd never been to Chick-fil-A, but she's so open to everything. You know what I mean?
So it's like you've got to understand the frustration comes from for him, the wording's different, the buttons are different, the screens are different. Scheduling different. Everything's just different than what you're used to. It's a different language. It's like a different country. And you're like, the first thing you want to do is go crawl in a hole and go, ""No, I want to go back to my own world.""
Speaker 1
 Don't do that.
Catherine
 But you know you can't do that if you want to grow.
Speaker 1
 Yeah. And it's just basically, I think it opens you up to a whole lot more data and and the reporting and all of that. I mean I think that it just would totally-
Catherine
 It's having a good attitude and getting excited about it. It's like, I read this thing last night. It says, ""If you want to love, you got to realize there's pain. If you want to laugh, you got to realize there's tears."" I mean, you got to embrace it and enjoy it and have fun and realize it's going to be overwhelming.
I mean I had a client, we called it jumping off the cliff days. He'd probably cuss me out the first 30 minutes of the meeting. Not really, but you know what mean. Get it off his system. And then he'd go, ""Okay, I'm ready to move on."" And now he's one of the best clients and he's fine. But he went through that six months of just, ""I'm going to do this. I mean I'm going to do this."" Kind of like going to the gym, I hate going to the gym. But you like the results, right?
Speaker 1
 Yeah.
Catherine
 So fighting through that.
Speaker 1
 Absolutely. Aspire provides a lot of training and support as far as integrating?
Catherine
 We did. But it's now getting to the point though, it's classroom videos, it's documents, it's less. We do have one-on-one, but it's open forum one-on-one. Where you're getting involved with other clients, which is good because you can talk amongst each other because you're using the system.
It's like the one guy I said that was frustrated. This guy got bigger companies. They needed a brewery where he lives and said, ""Let's just talk with Aspire every Friday and drink some beer.""
Speaker 1
 Nice.
Catherine
 And it's that forum of group. It's more group training and open Q and A. I've got accounting Q and A, I'm going to start having every day. Well you can come in, but you're coming in with one to 50 other clients and you're in line for answering questions. But everybody learns. I mean I had 35 people in the Q and A yesterday and only maybe six people ask questions. And everybody's just learning.
So we're trying to get away from the one-on-one because it's real hard when you have 800 clients and 200 employees to meet with people one-on-one the bigger you get. So we're pushing everybody to ... And in a way it's good. I mean, you're not babysitting, you're not enabling because I tend to enable. Because I want to be there, instead of pushing your kids going, ""No, you're going to learn this on your own. Don't come to me unless you really have a good question.""
And that's basically what we're trying to do is get them to embrace it and learn it on their own. Get in there and dig in and try it. And then if you make a mistake, come back and ask us. Instead of getting us to walk you through every step of every way. They do implementations. They do have two groups. One group training from the very beginning.
They call that cohort of growth, where you pay a lesser fee, but you're in with five to 20 other companies all learning at the same time. Or you can pay, I think it's more money, and get a one-on-one implementation manager and accounting specialists to get you through the setup, and how to use it for two or three months. And then you start to group training and come to the Q and A and things like that. So it depends on the price I think you want to pay. I'm not involved in that, but I think that's the way it works.
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I think you're right. And I think that group training is just invaluable because I think people learn from each other and-
Catherine
 They do.
Speaker 1
 Have this issue-
Catherine
 I learn something new every day myself.
Speaker 1
 We do.
Catherine
 Yeah.
Speaker 1
 All right. Well I think we've got enough. Is there any last finishing thoughts that you want to add to this as far as accounting apps go?
Catherine
 Not for accounting apps. The only thing I always throw in is tell people to review their balance sheet, reconcile their balance sheet. That's huge. I preach that at all our conferences. If nobody doesn't walk away with anything but, don't ignore your balance sheet no matter what app you use, what system you use. Just please don't ignore it. When you have a million dollars in inventory in your balance sheet, but you have nothing in the back, you need to question those numbers.
Speaker 1
 For sure.
Catherine
 So-
Speaker 1
 How often should you balance or do check your balance sheet? Like daily?
Catherine
 Once a month, every month.
Speaker 1
 Okay.
Catherine
 All the time.
Speaker 1
 All right.
Catherine
 It's like inventory. Don't let inventory in Aspire get to be $300,000 when you know you don't have anything. Don't let your balance sheet show you've got 300,000 inventory.
I had an accountant that was working for a client, now she's actually consulting with Aspire. That when I started working with the client after she left, he reached out and said, ""Can you help me?"" Their balance sheet was 200 something overstated on inventory. And so I'm like, I'm an accountant, so it sticks out.
It's like if you had your checking account and you've got a bank statement that says you had $100,000. Wouldn't you go, ""There's a problem here."" I don't know about you, but I don't have 100,000 in my bank account.
Speaker 1
 No, me either. I'm like, ""Goodness, score.""
Catherine
 But they ignore it. You start writing checks. And they say, ""Well, but you said I had 100,000. You mean I couldn't go buy this $90,000 car?""
Speaker 1
 Sure, why not? All right, well one more question before we go. So I know that your email was Catherine, but I see you have Cathy on there. What would you prefer you go by?
Catherine
 It doesn't matter. Cathy's what I've been, but I'll go to anything.
Speaker 1
 What's your title?
Catherine
 Call it anything.
Speaker 1
 What's your title at Aspire?
Catherine
 It's Manager, Accounting Manager. Let me see, I'm not sure. It is Manager of Accounting Integrations.
Speaker 1
 Okay, perfect. All right. Well-
Catherine
 I manage the accounting team, essentially.
Speaker 1
 Great.
Catherine
 That teaches the system. People see accountant and they think I'm an Aspire accountant, and I'm like, ""No, I don't want to be part of that.""
Speaker 1
 No. No, thank you. All right. Well, hey, well thank you-
Catherine
 Nice to meet you.
Speaker 1
 You too. Thank you so much for this very informative interview. I really appreciate it. I'm going to write this article and we'll get this over to Aspire. So have a-
Catherine
 Okay.
Speaker 1
 Great rest of your day.
Catherine
 You too. Bye.
Speaker 1
 Bye. Okay."

 00:00
Let's see.
Speaker 2
 |
 00:08
All
Speaker 1
 |
 00:08
Right, let me share. All right. Lemme know when you can see it. Yep.
 00:17
All right, cool. So, kind of just to like get a homepage here, I don't have the best data to, to show right now, like as far as like clean data in the system is one of our testing environments, but you'll kind of get the overall general gif. So you log into Aspire, you're gonna have kind of like a home dashboard page, which is going to try to drive, you know, a salesperson or account manager and a landscaping company. They're gonna log in, they're gonna start to see like, what are the tasks that I need to follow up on. So we have what we call activities in our system. So activities could be like appointments. So think of just literally like an integration with, um, Google or Microsoft where you can sync your calendar back and forth. Um, and you can kind of track the appointments, whether or not you're gonna do a virtual meeting, or maybe they're gonna go on site, um, to try to, to land, um, a deal with one of a client's.
 01:12
Um, they'll use these activities to kind of track those. So just like you see their appointments, tasks, issues are, um, just a different kind of flavor of what we call tasks. So issues a lot of times in our system are used to kind of like keep track of leads. So they might get a web lead that comes through their website, their first step maybe to create an issue for somebody inside the company to follow up on that lead. And essentially, so these, these activities are all being tracked with prospects and clients. So people they've, you know, already have an established relationship with, but you can configure kind of your dashboard to kind of give you a driving force into what should you be working on or what should you be focusing on so you're, you know, kind of focusing on the right lead or the right opportunity at the right time. Okay. So as you go through our left navigation here, you'll start to see activities. The calendar is where you'll start to see, um, where you might have appointments on your calendar, where those appointments are. You'll start to see like if I have tasks, um, scheduled,
 02:22
Let's see, for this opportunity,
 02:31
You know, you start to see some tasks. So somebody here could view like just their own calendar or they could view maybe their sales team calendar so they could view multiple people's calendars here at once. Um, and then we start to get into like, the relational part of our crm. So we have what we call contacts. So contact just, just like how you would think it's just a person record. So a contact could be an employee, could be a prospect, um, it could be a contact that, um, in the Aspire world, we do a lot of, um, commercial landscaping. A lot of our clients do. So you might have like one contact and Aspire that's actually associated with 10 different properties because they might be a property manager. Um, but you'd have one contact record as that main person. And then what you would do is Aspire is very property centric, is a good way to think about it.
 03:29
So anytime, anytime anybody does anything and aspire in regards to like, we've signed this client up, we're gonna go mow their lawn, we're gonna go build this patio, we're gonna go deliver mulch and spread it, you're always gonna be doing something at a property. So any of the work or services that are billed or agreed upon are always done at a property level. So you'll have a property record and just like kind of any other crm, you're gonna start to see some of the data points that you would think. So how much does this client owe me? Um, you know, do I have a last visit where I delivered services? Do I have a next visit? You'll start to see activities come to life. Where do I have any activities scheduled for this property? So a sales manager might pull up the property and see we have no next activity, um, for a, for a current customer.
 04:26
And that might be a red flag that, Hey, what's going on with this property? Um, I don't have many attachments here, but you could start to attach, um, attach documents, attach files and pictures that allow you to kind of go through and see kind of history on things. Um, so these aren't the greatest images, but these could be pictures of the property, let's say, where you might go onto the grounds and take pictures of the specific property that you want to keep on record that are important to this. And as we go down here to start to see what we call opportunities. So when we talk about like leisure prospects and aspire, you might know who the person is. So you might create a contact and like track that as a lead until you know what properties they might manage. So you might not know the properties they manage at first.
 05:21
So, um, you might have a contact that's a lead. You might also know of a property that's like in a neighborhood, or sometimes like a, at a landscaping company, you might have an account manager that's on the road all day visiting their different clients. And then they might see, they might be driving somewhere and see another building and be like, oh, like that would be probably a really good, um, account to land if we could get their mowing, um, you know, on an, a annual contract because we're already in the area with a crew that can handle that type of, uh, property. So in that case, they might enter the property. And basically when you're creating a property, you'll have different fields where, um, you can track like lead sources, you can track whether or not, uh, where is the field I'm looking for what industry they're in.
 06:16
And then there is whether or not they're active or not. So some people will use these types of fields to essentially like create a pipeline, if you will, where you could say, Hey, we wanna service these properties, but we don't know anything about them. And then somebody in the company would use activities or the CRM to figure out who the property, like who's, who's the property manager. And then they would create a contact and then associate that contact with the property. Okay. So there's like this work, what we call pre-op opportunity where um, I don't know if like the word like marketing qualified lead versus sales qualified lead makes sense to you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in Aspire, anytime like, you know, I have like a serious opportunity here to sell this client something like I've, I've kind of done the pre-qualification. So people will use the activities and contacts and things to kind of do that pre-qualification.
 07:11
And then it's like, okay, cool, now I'm going to give you an estimate, I'm gonna give you a proposal. So in our system, you'll create an opportunity and an opportunity is always associated with the property. And you'll basically go through and you'll build an opportunity just like you would in Salesforce. And I can't remember in Service Titan, they, I think they call 'em estimates in Service Titan mm-hmm. <affirmative> world. So in our world, we'll have an opportunity which will kind of define some information like what is the client's budget, um, you know, what's the stage or the status of the opportunity, when do we want to close this? Kind of the probability, um, is this a new sale? Is it a referral, is it a renewal? So we'll have like the key data points, and then what we have is we have estimates that live inside of an opportunity.
 08:03
So if I click on estimate tab, this is where you start to kind of like build, what am I gonna deliver here? Like what are the services, what are the items that might be consistent in the service? So, um, some of our clients might do irrigation work where they're gonna go in and install an irrigation system and obviously irrigation with them consist of all the parts that are gonna need to be installed. So the estimate is where you would build basically that, that quote, if you will, of this is, this is how many hours it's gonna take to complete. We're gonna charge you this per hour, this is, you know, how much we're gonna charge you for these, for these prices. And then, um, I don't have the option here, but you basically will have an option to, um, internally you could create like an approval workflow or if like it's an estimate over $10,000 and it's gotta go through internal review before it gets sent out to the client.
 08:59
Um, but there's like all these proposal workflows and stuff where you can email a proposal out, client will get it, they'll be able to e-sign it, um, to sign and win it. And then basically once the opportunity's won, then it flows into what we call our scheduling and work ticket module. So scheduling and work tickets in our world are like how the work comes to life. So those, um, I don't recall what Service Titan calls it, but those, you close an opportunity, let's say to install a new patio, it's gonna create a work ticket for, you know, to make sure you put it on your schedule, that you gotta go out there and it's gonna take four guys eight hours, um, to complete that. So on our schedule board is where you start to see the scheduling of, of that work, um, where you could kind of like go through and start to put your schedules, um, together.
Speaker 3
 |
 09:51
Okay. And then I assume, I assume this is like service tight where like say your dispatcher, whoever's doing the scheduling, if if they see like something they need to alter, they can just move drag things around.
Speaker 1
 |
 10:05
Yep.
Speaker 3
 |
 10:05
Okay.
Speaker 1
 |
 10:07
And you can even like, um, from here, like I could say, well this, this is really quoted for one day, but it's gonna take us two days and I can just drag it and it'll automatically like, create the second day for me. Um, so I dunno if you like saw that or you could just drag it.
Speaker 3
 |
 10:21
Gotcha.
Speaker 1
 |
 10:22
Yep. Build it out. I can move it to different, different routes. If I needed to book it down to this route like this, maybe their truck broke down. So I need to move that visit to a different, a different route. Um, and we do have, and this is where I guess I should have started off the conversation of, you know, CRM is kind of like a very ambiguous term, if you will. Yeah, yeah. Where in my world, um, I've been with Aspire for, uh, close to 18 months I guess now. And I don't come from the service industry, I come from, I come from a software background, but I mainly worked at, um, b NBC Sports and the PGA Tour, like a golf course software, um, like point of sales systems and tee time systems for golf courses. Um, but in my mind, when I came here, like Aspire, like globally, the entire system is a CRM in my world.
 11:18
Like you're, you're your have the ability to create these records, established relationships with these records, um, close opportunities with these records, um, you know, complete work with the records, send invoices out, um, have a customer portal where the client can go in and view their information, you know, you know, monitor what bills they might have outstanding, you know, put a pain and nothing on file. But it's really like the entire journey, right? Like, um, yep. Where internally here sometimes like you might talk to certain people about crm and it's just more about the sales part of it. Um, so I just wanna make clear from like your standpoint when you're talking crm, you know, it might, you might have that global type view that I have on it.
Speaker 3
 |
 12:01
Yeah, no, I, I used HubSpot and Salesforce at like, previous jobs, so Yeah, I'm, I'm familiar. Can't talk familiar with how that, how that works.
Speaker 1
 |
 12:11
Yeah.
Speaker 3
 |
 12:12
Um, so like, like that question I had, what are, like, I know what the advantages of using a CRM app are and like I understand how they improve marketing and things like that. Um, I guess the, the, the three below those two questions are the ones I really, I'm really interested with. Just kind of more in layman's terms, like what are the, what are the like ways that you can use Aspire, you know, for customer, the customer experience or you know, client building, client relationships and things like that. If that makes sense.
Speaker 1
 |
 12:48
Yeah, yeah, it does. Um, I mean, I think it's, it's just about having that one central source of truth. So the one piece that might be important to call out here is, uh, here,
 13:05
Does the word takeoffs mean anything to you? Probably not. I wouldn't expect it to, no. So, um, in the landscaping industry, a term that's commonly used is takeoff and you would not think it actually is what it, what you think it is based on the, on the lingo. So takeoffs are, um, like where I could go measure a property for a specific service and I can like measure it in ways where I might like break up a property into different types of mowers that I know I can, I need to service this property. Or, um, I know, hey, like if I look at this thing on a map, it's gonna be a thousand square feet maybe, but because they have certain drainage system or things that I can't move equipment around, I know like I can only service 800 square feet of it and these takeoffs will kind of flow into estimates.
 14:02
So kind of like once you're starting to enter these takeoffs into Aspire, you're kind of like getting a lot of that good detailed data in there where like, you'll never have to go back on site and like remeasure, you'll never have to like do some of those things where you might have to go on property to verify things. So having this one place for to store that type of information and use it for future estimates, I think is big. And then there's also a big thing that we see with our competitors is job costing. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> that aspires is usually, you know, if you take a look at our most 10 common competitors, we're probably always in the top three when it comes to job costing. And top three might be, um, you know, not as arrogant as probably like, we would like to claim probably number one in the industry with like job costing when it comes to that.
 14:55
So being able to understand that, hey, last year I quoted this, you know, I quoted that we were gonna go out and we were gonna mow, you know, two times a month and we were gonna, it was gonna take us x amount of time to do that work and we were gonna do it with this equipment. And at the end of the year, you are gonna be able to look in Aspire and understand, okay, like this is what I quoted, did we actually make money on the deal or not? Um, and then you can use that to like renegotiate or re-understand like, okay, where did we go wrong with the estimate? Did we, like, maybe I just had a new estimator that was going out in estimating jobs that just has since learned, or maybe like they just totally estimated the job wrong and now we need to go back to the client and try to like renegotiate because we can't keep doing this.
 15:43
Cuz if we do, we're gonna keep losing money on the deal. So when it comes to like, there's, there's two types of opportunities really. It's contracts and work orders. So contracts are gonna be the, the renewing of, um, you know, your monthly maintenance of mowing the lawn, trimming, um, those types of things. And then the work orders are gonna be more of like the projects of, uh, I'm gonna go build a new patio, I'm gonna go build a new deck, I'm gonna put in irrigation system, kind of like those one time type projects mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it might take you multiple visits to do it or multiple days to complete the project, but it's gonna be done through what we call a work order. And then it has change orders and kind of like the project management construction piece to it with work orders. So with both work orders and um, contracts, you're gonna have that same type of like job costing and really understand if you're making money or not.
 16:40
And in the landscaping industry, and even now, like the janitorial, I know you're only talking about landscaping, but in both landscaping janitorial, the margins are so low that if you're getting this stuff wrong, like you're gonna lose your ass. Um, so you, you wanna make sure that you're estimating properly and reevaluating those estimates on a regular basis. Um, so I think that's probably like where, where like the golden nugget would be of the value of Aspire, um, in terms of how we do that and how we, you know, kind of like bring that to the surface in the CRM of whether or not you're making money on on and feels good.
Speaker 3
 |
 17:19
Okay. So like, um, let's say you go ahead and a customer signs a contractor a service agreement. Like do they receive, you know, like with Service Titan, they start getting text messages, you know, they get correspondence, they get the little tracker showing the truck like, Hey, Jim's on his way over, he's really into basketball and, um, you know, whatever. Like, does, does the same kind of experience
Speaker 1
 |
 17:48
Happen in Aspire? Yes. No, that's a good call out. So two things. So when we talk about like contacts, um, opportunities or properties, if we were to like talk about email marketing today, like you can send bulk emails through Aspire, but it's not like a Mail Chimp or Marketing Pro, um, product today. But you can send one email, one off emails and send bulk emails, but you can't like, schedule campaigns today. Okay. And then we don't have SMS ability from like a pre-sale standpoint. So something on a roadmap that's coming up is, um, we're gonna integrate with Marketing Pro. So Aspire's going to be, um, it'll be a priced, like we're gonna charge for this type of integration, but basically we will on a nightly basis be sending our data into Marketing Pro and then clients will be able to build some of those campaigns, um, from the sales standpoint, a marketing standpoint, um, using Marketing Pro.
 18:53
And then sms, uh, will come down the road with that as well. We do have SMS messaging and email like notifications today, but it's all post sale. Like, um, to your point like, hey, well excuse me, like we were just here at your site and we completed this work and we're gonna send you an email with that information, or we're gonna send you an sms, or we do have appointment reminders where I could set it up that, hey, the day before I could send him, I could send the client an SMS that, hey, we're gonna be out at your property at this time to complete this service. Um, so we do have some of that stuff more on the transactional side of things. Okay. Um, if that makes sense. Um, so we're not as robust as Service tightness today with some of that reach out, but again, you're gonna get, you're kind of like talking to like, almost like the, like we're in the b2b, right?
 19:47
We're selling to businesses, but they're selling to consumers, so they're like kind of in the b2c, um, where they're, they want to get their customer sticky based on their technology. So it's like, um, we do have a cu a customer portal where again, like you said, or like you said, a client, uh, a property can go log in and see all of their history or manage kind of like what's going on, um, to kind of give sort of that stickiness feel. Um, and, and then we do have these notifications. We have Marketing Pro on the, on the mix, but there are like proposals when you send the proposals out of Aspire. Um, if you wanted to, we could probably send you a couple like more professional looking proposals, but it'll look very professional with when it goes out of like, Hey, we're gonna come do this $20,000 job. Like, you obviously don't want that just to look like my three year old daughter, um, you know, created it on Crayon. So there are some very professional looking layouts and proposals that are generated. Um, so hopefully that kinda answers.
Speaker 3
 |
 20:51
Yeah. Yeah. Um, one more, just one or two more questions. So like, let's say like that example you said earlier, like, you're driving around like your territory, you see this big office complex, like, ooh, they'd be a good customer. Like say you get a meeting with them and they're like, yeah, we want your, your services sound great. Like, could that person then, you know, pull out their mobile device, create a proposal right there, I assume like send it right directly to the person. Can you, can you just kind of like explain how that would work a little bit?
Speaker 1
 |
 21:26
Yeah. So I know with Service Titan, funny enough, we've had a couple people internally like need plumbing or like HVAC work and they've had, they've ended up like with technicians that came out and the companies that they work for use Service Titan. Yep.
Speaker 3
 |
 21:40
I've had that at home too. <laugh>.
Speaker 1
 |
 21:42
Yeah. So like they, they were like impressed and totally amazed at like the ability to do that type of estimate on the fly, like when the technician just like whipped out his iPhone and was able to build an estimate for them. Um, today we do have what we call a crew mobile application. So when the crews go out to actually do the work, they have a mobile device where they're clocking in, um, tracking that job time. So it goes back to the job costing, they're tracking the job time, but it's more about like the crew going out to deliver the service, not like a sales or CRM standpoint. Um, so from a mobile phone today, there's not a way to do an estimate. We do have a lightweight, um, it's kind of like our CRM light where you'll get a more light version. So less navigation options that you can, that you can do some very basics CR functions on an iPhone or Android, but it's not, estimates are not one of them.
 22:41
A lot of our clients will invest in iPads and if you have like a large enough or a good enough iPad on it, um, you can do, you'll get like the full version of the app on the iPad and you could do estimates that way. So that's what a lot of our clients are doing. Now. We're kind of in the midst of a project internally where our current crew mobile app is, um, older and kind of legacy technology if you will. So currently we're rebuilding the Crew mobile app into what we're calling Aspire Mobile, and then that'll be out in the next couple months. And then once Aspire Mobile is out, we'll do a second, um, iteration of it, um, following where we will allow more of that kind of functionality where you're talking about where people would be able to do more a depth CRM type functions, opportunity type functions, estimate type functions from their mobile device using that new Aspire mobile app.
Speaker 3
 |
 23:35
Okay. Is Crew Mobile, like, does that come with any service type in cus or Aspire customer? Is that a like all their, all of their team would get access to that?
Speaker 1
 |
 23:46
Yeah, yeah, it's included like in the price. So it's just a matter, like we don't charge like by user, by crew or anything, it's just you're, you're paying X amount to use this fire. Um, and Crew Mobile is just part of it and however many, you know, crew members or crew that you need to have access to it. Um, it's, it's basically obviously basically like the size of your company.
Speaker 3
 |
 24:07
Okay. Um, I guess just one last question and we've already sort of talked about this, but I have two sections in this article where they want me to talk about like, you know, like customer experience, customer satisfaction, um, so just pretend you're explaining you're a salesperson, you know, like talking to me. Um, actually I am a master gardener, so like pretend I'm gonna, I need to get a software like, like how can I, how can I use the software to like really like, wow my customers or like make their life easier, you know, things like that.
Speaker 1
 |
 24:47
Oh. Um,
Speaker 3
 |
 24:51
I, if there is anything and it doesn't need to be like on is is technical, but like just think.
Speaker 1
 |
 24:56
Yeah, no, it's a good question. I feel like, um, like brutal honesty, I feel like that's probably like our number one weak spot that we would get if somebody, if one of our competitors was selling against us. I feel like that's where they would hone in is on that customer experience. Um, with our customer portal the way it is today, it's kind of like our crew mobile where it's just older technology that we're planning on revamping Okay. Our client portal. But I think, you know, it's, yeah, I can I can I think about that one and get back to you?
Speaker 3
 |
 25:33
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1
 |
 25:34
I get you a good answer because I do feel like it's probably our weakest spot and I want to get, I want to ask a couple of our better sales engineers, like how they would respond to that.
Speaker 3
 |
 25:45
Okay.
Speaker 1
 |
 25:46
Um, because they're the ones that are, they're the ones that are gonna know what resonates with clients more than myself. So I think that'll be a good avenue to make sure that we get you a good, a good quote in there. Cuz otherwise I'm gonna be probably too, too brutally honest with
Speaker 3
 |
 26:02
No, I understand.
Speaker 1
 |
 26:03
Are weak point
Speaker 3
 |
 26:03
And, and just to be honest, I'll bet you that these questions that I've been asked to include, like, I'm sure somebody just ran like an SEO tool, you know, like, I'm not saying like these r tie directly to Aspire because like Yeah,
Speaker 1
 |
 26:20
No, but you're just trying to, I mean, I get it. I, uh, I worked at a startup before I came over here, um, so I kind of like got a trenched into like micro content and strategy and kind of SEO traction of using keywords and making sure you get content out out there that's, you know, search engines are finding to kinda like boost your, your search results. So I I totally get like, what's you're needing to do. And Robin um, Robin on our side, like kind of like gave, gave her the, the heads up that this was coming and um, she helped answer some questions too about what, what you guys are doing and why you're doing it so it makes sense.
Speaker 3

 26:54
I got you. And there's times where I have to tell service type and like, Hey, your SEO tool says we should mention this but it doesn't make sense or it's not even app applicable, you know, and then they're like, yeah, yeah you're right. That's stupid. So I mean it's
Speaker 1
 |
 27:07
Like where ai, AI sounds good in theory but sometimes you're just like how, you know, whatever, whatever thing is like building those things that it's catching, telling you to look at something, it's not as smart as you think it is.
Speaker 3
 |
 27:19
Oh my gosh. And especially with content, like we have two clients that are like, yeah we use AI cuz it's so cheap and then they turn around and they pay us $75 an hour to fix and in a lot of cases it's rewriting the entire article cause it's so terrible. And I'm sure AI is great in certain like industries, but the content, it'll be like the best c R M is a C R M that does customer relationship management. You know, like it's just like garbage it makes, it's just
Speaker 1
 |
 27:50
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks Captain.
Speaker 3
 |
 27:51
Obvious. Obvious. Yeah. Like yeah so I think that stuff's hilarious cuz you go on LinkedIn and people are like, eh, yeah it is revolutionizing, no, there'll be no writers in five years. And it's like, yeah, I don't think so.
Speaker 1
 |
 28:04
We just, we're working on like a new scheduling, um, well kind of like Service Safe has that scheduling assistant feature. Yeah. Um, we're looking at doing something similar to that and that was like one of one of the sarcastic comments was like, we'll we'll just put AI in the title of the feature and then we can just charge billions of dollars
Speaker 3
 |
 28:24
<laugh>. Yeah, exactly. That's funny. All right, well yeah, I think this gives me some good stuff to work with. Um, yeah, if there's anything else that pops up that you think would be beneficial, feel free to e email it my way and, um, if
Speaker 1
 |
 28:40
Yeah, feel free to, um, feel free to bounce anything off me to, um, kind of, I'm, uh, running outta gas at the end of the week, so probably all over the map. So if if you think of something early next week, I'll follow up with you on the sales standpoint. But at any point if you got questions or you want me to kind like double check or validate something you heard today, I can definitely definitely give you the time to do that.
Speaker 3
 |
 29:03
Okay. Yeah, that sounds great.
Speaker 1
 |
 29:06
Cool.
Speaker 3
 |
 29:06
Cool. Well yeah, I appreciate your time today and good chatting with you.
Speaker 1
 |
 29:11
Yeah, you as well. Hopefully, uh, we'll, we'll, uh, cross again.
Speaker 3

 29:14
Yeah, for sure. All right, well have a good Yep, you too. Have a good weekend.

 So Bryan, so let's see. Let me look back at this email. Based on your comments, [inaudible 00:00:12], landscapers, don't know how to purchase... Okay. Are there any key points that you would want to get across in this article? So, are there any basic points about purchasing? I was thinking, I have five questions here. Are there any blind spots that you see landscapers have when it comes to purchasing? How can technology help landscape be better at purchasing? Are there any key pieces of data that you think landscapers should prioritize when it comes to being better or improving their purchasing process? Are there any resources or partnerships that landscape companies can leverage to better save money on purchasing or be more profitable, be more efficient? Looking ahead, how can landscapers be better prepared for fluctuations in supply and pricing moving forward? Is there anything that kind of strikes you about any of those questions? Are there any avenues that you thought you might want to go down with this piece?
Bryan Mours
 Great question. Because there's so many. I guess the main concept is, if you didn't estimate it, don't purchase it. Meaning, in order to be a profitable company and maintain your gross margins, you need to understand that the essence of good purchasing starts with creating a very detailed and accurate estimate. And where software kind of comes into play is, and this idea that, the software creates a grocery list of items that you need to then use, to go out and purchase and different from maybe when you're at the store and you're grabbing stuff off the, [inaudible 00:02:55]. If you put a $100 in your pocket and you've created a grocery list that you knew the prices of the items were, [inaudible 00:03:03], and they total up to a $100, what would happen if you went to the grocery store and you grabbed a candy bar and a bag of Doritos and all of this stuff that wasn't on the grocery list? When you got to the register, the cashier would say, ""That'll be $125.80 cents.""
Bryan Mours
 Well, I only brought a hundred dollars or I'm only getting a $100 from my customer, to go out, buy the materials for their job. Now I've just spent $125.80 cents. So, where does that extra $25 come and 80 cents come out of? It comes out of the landscaper's pocket, not the customer's pocket. And so, when you're doing work for a client, it's important to understand that you need to, again, be detailed, make sure you grab everything that you think you're going to need for the job, include it in your estimate so that you can create a good, solid grocery list to go out and do your shopping with. And if, there is an additional need, for the job, that then becomes a change order for the client to then create add to their grocery list.
Bryan Mours
 Because now, you've given them said, ""Here, you're going to need Doritos too, because remember you got kids at home and they want something to snack on."" And so, now that gets added to the grocery list. And then ultimately, that's going to mean you're going to be able to look at and have good job costing again, back to technology, understanding whether or not your jobs are hitting the gross margin that you want them to hit. And then ultimately, not stealing from your bottom line, your net profit, because, of the fact that you bought stuff that was not on your grocery list, does that make sense?
Abby Hart
 That's great. That's a really clear analogy, Bryan. So, okay. The essence of good purchasing, very detailed estimate. So, that's a good way to kind of link what we do to this purchasing piece. So, I guess that kind of, [inaudible 00:05:48], into, are there any key pieces of data that landscapers should prioritize when it comes to improving the purchasing process? So, being aware of their job costs, ensuring they're not stealing from their from, [inaudible 00:06:05].
Bryan Mours
 I think part of it is, again, now I've moved what I've estimated over to a purchasing module. And now, it's maintaining some sort of control over that. And like you mentioned, there should be a good purchasing process. The problem with landscape companies is, purchasing is one of those things that they take, they, A, it's difficult, nobody wants to do it. And so, they hand out credit cards or P cards to all of their crew leaders and they go, ""Okay, go buy what you need."" Well, anytime you hand a credit card to the wild west, they're just going to run around and buy whatever they need. And, that's where things get on hand. And so, creating a PO system, [inaudible 00:07:08], our system, PR system Purchase Receipt system is essential. And contacting your vendors, what I did, was I contacted my vendors and other companies using, [inaudible 00:07:20], do this, and they go, ""Look, nobody can come into your shop and buy anything without a PO number.""
Bryan Mours
 If they don't have a PO number, they can't buy it. Even if they have a credit card in hand, they still can't buy it. Because, it has to be an authorized purchase that's in the system that says, ""Hey, I'm matching this up to something I estimated on a job."" And so, requiring all of the people that... I like more of a centralized purchasing process, meaning there's a person in control of understanding what's been estimated and what can be purchased and that person hands out a PO. And then, receives the receipt back when, or receives the paperwork if they received that or picked up those items so that they can then move it through the process from created to received and then to approved. Meaning I got the invoice now from the vendor. I'm matching that to what I saw on the invoice or on the packing slip that was turned in, ""Everything matches up. Okay. It's good to go. We're okay to pay our vendor for this.""
Bryan Mours
 Now. So, really, like I said, I like a centralized process. However, some companies aren't big enough to have a dedicated person to do purchasing, which is why decentralize it. Meaning they tell everyone to just go buy what they need, but there still needs to be a certain amount of control over the creating of the POs. And so, minimizing who can create POs and telling vendors that they need a PO, helps align and create a good process for purchasing.
Abby Hart
 So, you would just communicate with your vendor really? Or your vendor contacts and say, ""Hey, you cannot allow any of my people to come in here..."" And, typically landscape companies work with a specific supplier. What's the likelihood of people just, I don't know, running over to Home Depot and just buying up, [inaudible 00:10:12].
Bryan Mours
 Even with home Depot, what typically you do is you'll set up some sort of corporate account, maybe a Home Depot card. So, you get more of a contractor pricing. And what Home Depot can do in any vendor is basically they flag your account. Meaning when you go in and say, I'm purchasing for Bryan's Landscape Service, the cashier, it pops up on their screen, it says, ""PO required."" And they can't finish the purchase until they give them a PO number. Now, everyone knows the workaround to that is, just give them nine, nine, 9, 9, 9, And a way to go. And that's, again, that's one of those jokes in the industry,
Abby Hart
 Right.
Bryan Mours
 Everything I buy is PO 9, 9, 9, 9, 9.
Abby Hart
 Okay, great. It looks like there's... So, I have a fair amount here. We'll talk about kind of how the estimate is the kind of the crux of good purchasing, if you didn't estimate it, don't purchase it. What I'm kind of seeing out of what you're talking about here, it might be kind of fun just because this is a short, 400 words is not long at all. Maybe this is kind of do's and don'ts sort of, do create the control over your purchasing, your PO process. Don't, [crosstalk 00:12:01].
Bryan Mours
 Don't make purchasing the wild west.
Abby Hart
 Right.
Bryan Mours
 Everyone has a credit card and is running around buying things they don't need or they need at their house.
Abby Hart
 I'm looking back at this email. I'm not actually super familiar with Pro Landscaper. Will this be in print or just online?
Bryan Mours
 Great question. [inaudible 00:12:31].
Abby Hart
 I can reach out to, [crosstalk 00:12:33].
Bryan Mours
 I think it's print, as well as online. They just did an event that we didn't participate in that. But, looked like it had a lot of... It was called Futurescape down in Atlanta. But, it looked like a lot of our clients attended it and, [crosstalk 00:12:58].
Abby Hart
 Oh, really?
Bryan Mours
 And as well, it had a fair showing as far as some of our competitors with regards to other software vendors and such. And so, they've already got an allegiance to quite a few landscape businesses, software, equipment, all of these different things that... I was shocked because I, A, I never heard of Futurescapes and B, I never heard of Pro Landscaper, but they seem to be making a pretty significant surge, maybe trying to go after modern landscape and those types of, [crosstalk 00:13:43].
Abby Hart
 Yeah. And I want them. I'm curious, [crosstalk 00:13:45].
Bryan Mours
 Management.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. Because, it looks like... Pro Landscape South, they must be targeting kind of all these huge companies from Texas to Virginia. Interesting. I'll have to keep an eye out for Pro Landscaper. Okay. Is there anything else that you want this article to touch on Bryan? Is there anything else as far as kind of looking ahead, how can landscapers be better prepared for fluctuation, [crosstalk 00:14:24].
Bryan Mours
 Well, I think a nice thing to maybe close with or say somewhere along the way is, kind of goes back to what the webinar and that is with the volatility of costs, purchasing is even more important today than it ever has been. Because, you could have estimated something at $10 today and it could be $20 tomorrow. And so, understanding your costs and what you're purchasing and adjusting your costs to account for this volatile market is very, very important in order to maintain your company's profitability.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. I definitely remember the pricing conversation as part of that webinar. Let's see. Okay. I'm, [inaudible 00:15:30]. Okay. That's a good point. Is there any advice or direction that we can give our clients about, kind of when to adjust those? When to adjust and communicate pricing adjustments to clients? I feel like that's always a concern.
Bryan Mours
 Yeah. That's a great question. It probably is. You probably...
Abby Hart
 This is probably not outside of the scope of this article, [inaudible 00:16:01].
Bryan Mours
 Yeah. But, it's good knowledge and maybe there is something you can say in association with kind of what we're saying, there kind of about understanding your cost and just maybe mention in there, you have a great relationship with your clients. Don't be afraid to communicate the fact that your prices are increasing. They know, they watch the news too. And so, they know that there's going to be price increases. But be fair and don't necessarily pass along all of the cost increases to your clients.
Abby Hart
 Right. And I think that, I forgot, I can't remember who mentioned it in that webinar. They kind of talked about the balance of, what to pass along. And, if you know your numbers, then you can justify a price increase relatively easily.
Bryan Mours
 Right.
Abby Hart
 But, if you just shoot from the hip on what your increase is and then they ask about it, then, you're in tough spot. Okay, great. Yeah. Is there anything else that we want to touch on? I think that I've got...
Bryan Mours
 No, I think it's good.
Abby Hart
 Okay, great.
Bryan Mours
 Those are the key areas.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. And this is not long.
Bryan Mours
 No, that's right. 400 words, it's, [crosstalk 00:17:28].
Abby Hart
 That's nothing. And, when Robin mentioned it to me, I was like, ""Oh, this is a long article then."" 400 words inst much. Okay, great. I'm going to try... We're in this tough spot with all this janitorial content right now, but let me try and get this together this week. So I can... At the very latest, I'll have something for you to review early next and we can get this along too Angelique. Are you all right if I reach out to her?
Bryan Mours
 Sure.
Abby Hart
 Directly and kind of ask her about specifics about where this will end up?
Bryan Mours
 Yeah, absolutely.
Abby Hart
 Fantastic. All right. Great. Thanks so much for your time, Bryan. Oh, [crosstalk 00:18:13].
Bryan Mours
 All right. No. Thanks for your help.
Abby Hart
 No problem. One quick question. Unrelated to this, we had a, kind of just a discovery call [Chenmark 00:18:26] today. The director of marketing reached out and mentioned, they'd be interested in partnering with us on a webinar about how to prepare for selling a company because they, I don't know, they saw a newsletter of ours and wanted to chat with us about partnering on this webinar and that could potentially lead to other content and kind of a longer term thing. But if we do a webinar about this, who would be a person that would be good to kind of co-present this information with, I believe it's a CEO of Chenmark. Would that be you? Would that be somebody else?
Bryan Mours
 Yeah. I don't think there's would be anyone else that could do it besides me.
Abby Hart
 Yeah.
Bryan Mours
 So, I'm happy to.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Bryan Mours
 Who were you talking to?
Abby Hart
 [Jamie Stores 00:19:28]. I think he's been there a year.
Bryan Mours
 I was going to say he's new.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. You must know somebody over there at Chenmark.
Bryan Mours
 Oh, Dave. And, I know first names. Daniel, I think, was the other guy's name.
Abby Hart
 I'm sorry? What was the other name?
Bryan Mours
 Daniel.
Abby Hart
 Okay. Yeah. I can't remember. He mentioned a couple other people, but I think, Palmer or somebody, or Parker, I can't remember. No, it's in my notes. But, let's see. He says, ""We'd be looking, [inaudible 00:20:09], webinar along the lines of how to prepare selling your business. What does buyer looking for when evaluating the landscape company?"" I think that they already have a deck in place, because they've done this presentation in other industries. I think they did it for, oh God, now I can't remember what industry they did it for recently, just because they're in so many other industries. But they've never done it for the landscape industry.
Abby Hart
 And as far as timing goes, it probably wouldn't... We asked about, if he had timing in mind, he said, it could be... They see their most volume and their most organic traffic to their site at the end of every season. Because people hit a or wrap up a really punishing snow season or landscape season. And then they're like, ""Oh, let me sell this. Because, I don't want to chew this anymore."" So I think, we would probably look at doing this, it could be kind of closer to the Fall and we might kind of support this with other types of content leading up to it. So, I don't think that there's anything in the near turn, [crosstalk 00:21:23], that we're planning on doing. But this is something that will probably keep going in the background, but you would be the person, [crosstalk 00:21:30]. Okay.
Bryan Mours
 Yeah. Just kind of reach out to me.
Abby Hart
 Sounds good. Right. Great. Thanks so much, Bryan.
Bryan Mours
 You bet. Thank you.
Abby Hart
 Appreciate your time. Bye.
Bryan Mours
 Take care."

 All right, Chris. So, what is your title over there at Enviroscapes?
Chris Kline
 I am a Landscape Designer and Commercial Estimator.
Abby Hart
 Okay, great. Are you the primary person that Joshua speaks with about Land One or-
Chris Kline
 Yes. Sorry.
Abby Hart
 Okay, perfect. Fantastic. So this is going to be, because I didn't realize until after the fact that Enviroscapes is also an Aspire user, I'm going to ask you background about Enviroscapes, and then we'll talk about Land One and then we'll also talk about Aspire. But if you feel like you're not the person to talk about Aspire in great detail, then I can talk to somebody else at Enviroscapes, if you think that's a good idea. Do you think that you can speak intelligently about both or-
Chris Kline
 Yeah, for the most part, Mike May, I would say he's probably the... he's with our corporate team. He's probably the most well versed in Aspire, but I don't have a lot of experience here at Enviroscapes outside of Aspire.
So the transition point may be a little, you know what I mean?
Abby Hart
 Gotcha.
Chris Kline
 We were purchased by Aspire. I worked for American Beauty Landscaping and we were purchased by Enviroscapes in 2017 and Enviroscapes got Aspire in 2018. So there wasn't a whole lot... I don't know how well I can speak of the two.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. So, [crosstalk 00:01:41] you've been pretty well entrenched with Aspire but you have experience with other software, correct?
Chris Kline
 Oh yeah. Correct.
Abby Hart
 Okay, perfect. Yes. Well then that honestly might be enough, and it actually is an interesting perspective that you bring as a designer and an estimator, because I've primarily been speaking with owners and the decision maker behind bringing on Aspire.
So it'll be cool to talk about someone who uses it daily, because some of these guys don't. Okay, great. So Chris, how long have you've been with, I guess technically in, Enviroscapes, since 2017, you said? Or with your company?
Chris Kline
 2017. Yep.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. And how many people currently work at Enviroscapes?
Chris Kline
 250.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Chris Kline
 In that ballpark.
Abby Hart
 Okay. Can you talk a little bit about customer mix, surface mix and revenue? Is that something that you have that you can tell me, or-
Chris Kline
 Absolutely. Yeah. So we are a commercial landscaping company. We do some large-scale high end residential work, but it's mostly tied to commercial.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Chris Kline
 So we're 40% landscape, about 8.5 million. We're 40% maintenance and enhancements, at probably around nine million and then snow we're 20% at about four million.
Abby Hart
 Okay, perfect. I'm sorry. So doing the math, total rev is... you eight and a half nine and four?
Chris Kline
 Yeah, 21, 21 and a half.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. Let's see. Can you talk a little bit about your background and how you ended up at Enviroscapes and your day to day as an estimator?
Chris Kline
 Yeah, so like I mentioned before, I worked for probably the largest landscaping company in the Youngstown, Ohio market, which was American Beauty Landscaping. We were purchased by Enviroscapes in 2017.
And I was part of that merger, well purchase, not a merger. And so Enviroscapes we just integrated into their processes and their company. And as far as sales and estimating and design, I was actually a Field Supervisor. So I have about 15 to 16 years of in field experience with a hardscape field supervisor. So... high end residential, commercial work, installs, and I got the opportunity to move into sales.
So I grabbed the bull by the horns. So it was a real sink or swim type situation. And I was able to keep my head above water and I been doing this ever since. So it was really a great opportunity for me.
Abby Hart
 That's great. What drew you to the landscaping industry and your initial work in it, and then now to sales?
Chris Kline
 So I've always worked in landscaping. I really, other than some jobs here or there in college, when I was 16, I started cutting grass. And when I got my job at the first actual professional landscaping company, I ran a mow crew, and mowed grass for two or three years, got my pesticide applicator's license.
Did pesticide application fertilization and moved into a Maintenance Supervisor. And then I went into hardscape construction. So I'm pretty well versed in pretty much all aspects of landscaping, but really since I was 16, it's all I've really ever known.
I always wanted to do more. I was always very creative, very good at art, those types of skill sets. So it's really cool to look back now and it's like, ""Wow, all those talents that I have when I was younger, I'm actually using them now in my mid thirties too, as a career.""
And I never really thought I would... I thought I'd be laying brick the rest of my life, but it was just the right opportunity at the right time. And that's just the environment here. Enviroscapes, we like that we can do things here that you never really thought possible. We give those opportunities within first, and I think that's really a good thing.
Abby Hart
 That's great. So what do you like about what you're doing now, versus being a field supervisor?
Chris Kline
 The challenges day in and day out, just new, it's refreshing. I feel like I've built every type of patio I can build. I've laid driveways, I've [inaudible 00:07:06] and not that I don't still love that work, I still do, but it's just a new set of challenges on a day to day basis.
And it really was just refreshing to me to do something different and challenge myself as a person and professionally. So I think that's what I like most about it. I like the analytics of it, the dealing with customers. I think that was always my strongest suit was just dealing with the customer. And now it's on a much larger scale and it's not just a residential customer, it's just general contractors and architects and it's... Just being able to really, how do I want to phrase it, be being able to tap into that strong suit that I know I have and do that on a daily basis, pretty much.
Abby Hart
 That's great. So let me ask you this. Were you at Land One or using Land One before you, well, I guess you wouldn't have been using Land One as a Field Supervisor?
Chris Kline
 No.
Abby Hart
 Okay. So can you talk a little bit about the challenges you were facing prior to onboarding with Land One?
Chris Kline
 So I think the most specific example would probably just be lessening that degree of estimation error.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Chris Kline
 So allowing me to really provide the most accurate estimate that could be the quantity of plants on a job site, to just quickly measuring properties through a near map or a PDF, getting the volume or calculating the volume of material in an area more quickly. Those types of things, Land One has definitely helped.
I do use AutoCAD a little bit, but this is just a little bit more of a streamlined, basic tool. And I find myself using Land One 98% of the time. And Joshua was always really great at listening to the customer and, ""Hey, what do you want to see? Or how can we integrate this to make this more efficient?""
And he took our feedback and then a lot of times in those situations, you're like, ""Yeah, it'll happen.""
And he would implement... It would almost be within weeks. It's like, ""Hey, that thing we talked about, you can do that now."" Which was really cool because you felt like you were really getting feedback, and he was really listening to the clients.
So I think that's what really sold me on Land One, was just that relationship we have with him and just how far it's came. I mean, it really truly was a takeoff program at first and now I feel like it's a design program.
Abby Hart
 All right. So you mentioned streamlining the process, more exact estimates and measurements. Were you considering any other programs prior?
Chris Kline
 Yeah, there was a few others. To be specific, I probably couldn't remember because I did look at so many of them. We were shipping jobs out for takeoffs, a lot of times with there being, we have two Designer Estimators with Enviroscapes, and then we have a Business Developer and we have Account Managers in the maintenance side.
So there'd be times where we would get overwhelmed with projects and it was, ""Hey, let's ship this one off our takeoff. Let's just let somebody else do it, free our hands of it.""
And so I think that when Land One came across and it was just so simple to work with, you so quickly get what you need out of it. It just made more sense to do it in house because I was being able to get two things done in the time it took me to do one.
Abby Hart
 Can you get specific about an instance where Land One changed your business for the better, a particularly hard project design, or-
Chris Kline
 Yeah, I mean, there's been a few, it's hard to nail down to one. We've been on a project now where we've been doing a park restoration project for the past two and a half years.
And when it's all said and done, it's going to be a $5 million project and to be able to take that plan set. And we were a General Contractor on this project too. So it wasn't just landscaping. There was asphalt work construction, we're running a $900,000 pavilion structure build right now at this park.
So being able to use it and push its limits, and use it for things that most people don't, it helped. I mean, I was able to take that entire plan set document, and that's a lot of landscape plans and a lot of things like that. And it might sound funny, but the color coding of shrubs and color coding of perennials, things like that, it just made it easier on the guys in the field.
So you get that positive feedback it makes you, ""Wow."" This is worth it. It's worth the work. And they're starting to... Because if it trickles down to the production, if it makes my job easier, it makes their job easier, then it's a win for everybody. So that would probably be the one instance that comes to my mind is I was able to use on a job of that scale. And it was just a vital tool.
Abby Hart
 That's great. So, better communication and clearer plans [crosstalk 00:13:00] for your production crews. Great. Are there any specific metrics that you can point to as to how Land One has helped your design process or estimating process? I don't know if you guys track how fast these things go out, but are there any specific metrics like that?
Chris Kline
 Not really in that regard, as far as how fast we can turn around a bid, or turn around an estimate. From a design aspect, I think the integration of Near Map, that made a big impact because I'm no longer going to [inaudible 00:13:41] to pull an aerial photo or a measurement. I can do it all in one space.
Which is what's exciting to me about Aspire purchasing Land One is, I'm excited for what the future holds and that integration's really going to present itself a year or two, three years from now. So that was huge because as simple as that sounds, it's one less step and every time you got out another step, you're being more efficient, more productive.
So the Near Map was really great. I always teased Joshua a little bit because there was no copy paste feature. So I'd get these large distribution centers where there might be 50 island beds that are the exact same size. And it's like, ""Okay, this doesn't feel efficient.""
Now I can do that. And to set the little details go a long way. As far as like... I know it makes me more productive. I turn things around quicker, but as far as tracking that time, we really don't... we track our production probably a lot more closer.
Abby Hart
 Okay. So it's funny that you mentioned [Goilon 00:14:59] because you know that Aspire also acquired Goilon. How are you... now I'm just curious, because it's my job to know about all these solutions as we acquire them or as they partner with us, but how were you using go Goilon in conjunction with Land One, or, were you?
Chris Kline
 Oh yeah, a little bit. If it was a presidential project I could get on there to get my benchmark on a design, to going to design a patio or I'm going to design the layout of a sidewalk or a landscape.
I would go to Land One, get that benchmark measurement, or snip a photo, or download that photo and then transfer that to Land One, and then do my overlay where now it's very simple. It's right there.
I [inaudible 00:15:51], it pulls it up and I'm still getting that nice crisp image, depending on the year. There's leaves on the trees and all those fun things that come into play with that. But it's just, again, it just keeps cutting out that other step.
Abby Hart
 Okay, great. I'm still getting a sense for, or how... now that aspire has acquired Land One, the two solutions are not integrated yet. So can you... there is the plan for that, but I don't have a day, I just know that it's coming, but can you tell me how you use the two solutions in conjunction with each other? Just so I have a sense of the workflow, I guess.
Chris Kline
 Of?
Abby Hart
 I'm sorry, Land One and Aspire. So you design... Can you just walk me through?
Chris Kline
 Yeah. So, the good thing about Land One is... like AutoCAD, it doesn't necessarily give you layers, but in a sense, it does just a little bit more of a basic fashion.
I look at those plants, I go down through and create all the areas that I need to create. I do my take off and now there's that step from taking the information that I've gathered on Land One and transferring it over to my opportunity and Aspire. Now, what I hope to see is that integrate it does that for me, because that would begin cutting off that next step.
We're pretty well trained at that here. I think we do it our very best to try to find the quickest route to be more productive and be efficient. And that's definitely going to be that next step, which I'm confident they'll figure it out. That's what I'm doing right now. So that is that extra step, just transferring that information, but I'm no longer using that spreadsheet off to the side, so in a way I am still being a little bit more efficient.
Abby Hart
 Okay, great. I guess let's switch gears to Aspire for the moment and then we'll come back together and talk about both of them in conjunction. So can you tell me your experience using like business management software when you were at American Beauty and then... Were you using a software there?
Chris Kline
 I mean, we've always used some type of a software, but it was probably more paper based.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Chris Kline
 Especially tracking times, so my experience with it was, again, from more of a field perspective, so making sure that my guys were clocking in, clocking out, making sure they were tracking billable and unbillable, all of those things. So I think that was probably the biggest challenge is not being able to really easily track that and see job costs.
That's been the biggest change is, I mean, what can't Aspire do? I mean, thing is, we really can see the big picture on just about everything.
And it's always evolving. I mean, it's evolved since we first started using it and we used to have management meetings where we would just share what we've taught ourselves. We were still learning it. And this is back in 2018, 2019. And it was like, ""Hey, I found out that you could do this or you could do this.""
And so it was just a collaborative effort really. And I guess that's my answer.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Okay. So job costing when you were in the field, a lot of it had to do with clocking labor and that kind of thing. Can you talk about once you moved over to the estimating design side, how Aspire impacted your day to day, I guess, aside from the job costing... Does that make sense?
Chris Kline
 I guess if I'm following you... maybe not job costing, but everything as far as ordering material and tracking POS and things like that, just having the ability for the guys in the field to pull it up on their phone and know the estimate, see the estimate, know where they're supposed to order their material from. It got a lot of the guess work... I think in the past, you may have a good relationship with a vendor and you automatically go to that vendor, but maybe that's not the most cost efficient answer for this project.
And you don't know what the estimator was thinking and you don't have that information readily available to you. Now you're buying your purchase material, that's more than what's a bid for the project. So really just some clarity, from the office to the field on, it talks to each other, so both of them know what each other's thinking and track that. And just again, it all goes back to productivity, so-
Abby Hart
 That's great. Okay.
Chris Kline
 Is that what you were looking for?
Abby Hart
 Yeah, absolutely. So, really a lot of it is... Communication, clarity, efficiency, cost effectiveness. That's really what I'm hearing. Is there anything else as far as... I'm trying to think of other value ads that I typically hear from Aspire customers.
Sorry. The last person I talked to was a Controller and that is a whole different set of... Let's see here. Any other operational efficiencies that you can think of that Aspire provides?
Chris Kline
 I mean, it's a little bit of everything. I mean a contact book. To be able to... I'm constantly searching for contacts in there because I know if I haven't dealt with that person in the past, my counterpart in Louisville, [Rhonda 00:23:01], she probably has. So I really truly think I use it just about for everything that it can be used for, from somebody in my position.
Just looks on properties and being able to pull up addresses and contacts and all of that. It really is just a vital toll. I mean, it's more than just an estimating tool. It's more than just a sales tool or anything. It just helps the business all the way around, just smooth.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Okay. I guess that really covers how your roles have improved using Aspire. Can you talk about what challenges Enviroscapes is currently facing? Obviously it's always growing, you guys just got acquired by Shell. Is that accurate?
Chris Kline
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 So what business challenges are you guys facing currently and how can Aspire and One Land help to meet those challenges? How have they been helping to meet those challenges?
Chris Kline
 So if I think of challenges, I think the first that comes to my mind is probably just the supply chain issue that we're facing all over. With this state of the world that we live in, the daily impacts that we're seeing within this industry and maneuvering those challenges and finding sustainable solutions, I think the pandemic really affected business and for that matter, continues to affect business, I think we have to constantly retold ourselves. And I think aspire has been a huge part of that. I think the green industry as a whole has done a really good job at maneuvering through the pandemic. I think, maybe I'm biased, but I think a [inaudible 00:25:04] especially we've really done a fantastic job making sure that we're keeping our employees safe and healthy and putting the right processes in place.
And if we wanted to work fully remote with Aspire, we could. There's just so many things that this program, I think, helps when it comes to the way that the world seems to be trending. It connects us all, being able to not be cooped up in an office with coworkers, but being out on job sites, but still being able to access all that data is important.
And I think it was... I wonder sometimes how we would've really done it when it first happened, because at first everybody was terrified and nobody really knew what was going to happen. And it was like, ""Are we going to have jobs? Are we considered essential, are we not considered essential?""
And nobody knew, and I think that as things became clear, I think what became clear to me with Aspire was, wow, how would we have done this without Aspire? And I think that was... to be able to sit in my living room and hop on and create an opportunity, that made things very easy.
So I just think that as far as challenges looking forward, who knows, with the state of this world, but I think it's a good tool to have in your arsenal for sure, because, it's proven effective in the past, so-
Abby Hart
 Great. I wanted to touch on, and this is something that I don't think I've heard anybody talk about, but you mentioned that Land One and to a certain degree Aspire, although I'd like to hear what you have to say about it, but Land One and maybe Aspire have enabled you to use these creative talents. Can you talk a little bit about how knowing these tools and using them effectively might help? other people in the industry...
Chris Kline
 So a good example of that is I've been able to help our maintenance department on multiple occasions, and it could be something as basic as a takeoff on a park for snow and ice, but creating details, you see these landscape details, and then plan sets, and it's not just a takeoff program.
You can use all the tools that takeoff program offers you, and you can create an actual detail on how you want a project built. It doesn't have to be a 2D, aerial image, it can be a masonry wall. It could be a set of steps. It is really your creativity, I think, is the only thing that limits what Land One can do.
I've overlaid renderings that were hand drawn with it, and been able to create a pretty full piece to present to a client. There's just a lot of different things you can do with it.
It's not AutoCAD, but it's for what it is, it serves a lot of those same purposes. I think you just [inaudible 00:28:45] willing to push it.
I know Josh and I shared designs that I had done and some things like that. And I think he even made the comment once that, ""You're using it a little bit more than what it's intended for, but that's good.""
So, it's a cool program. For me, I just can get lost in just playing around in it and seeing what you can do.
Abby Hart
 That's awesome. That's great. So, Chris, can you talk a little bit about what your goals are for this year and how Aspire and Land One can help you achieve those goals?
Chris Kline
 Yeah. I think my goal's always the same. It's going to sound cliche, but it's just to continue to grow and improve as a professional. I think that as I evolve as a designer and an estimator, I'm confident that Aspire and Land One will evolve along with me. So I think, like I said, it's been an invaluable tool for me.
And, I believe with that integration with Aspire that it's just going to become more beneficial to that growth. So I think that as time moves on, I mean, like I said, I really am excited. I told Josh that multiple times when I found out that Aspire acquired Land One, it was like, ""Oh, cool.""
It wasn't like it was another software program that we don't use where it's, ""Which direction is this going to go?"" Those were the two biggest tools that I use every day, is Aspire and Land One and now-
Abby Hart
 Oh, wow.
Chris Kline
 So now that they're coming together, that's exciting for me because to make our jobs as easy as possible and still... I think my goal is, like I said, just to always improve and always grow and I think that's how they can help.
Abby Hart
 That's awesome. Great. Let me think if I have any other questions that I wanted to ask... Chris, now that I've got you.
Chris Kline
 No, you're good.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. I mean-
Chris Kline
 [inaudible 00:30:54] so if you don't...
Abby Hart
 Do you read any particular websites to get education or information about the industry, Chris? This is just a question for me as a content creator in this space.
Chris Kline
 Yeah, Landscape Management, I'm a huge LinkedIn guy, so I'm always on LinkedIn reading. I would say probably I listen to my peers in the industry more than I do articles against the magazines or anything like that.
I have a stack of them here, but, I want to know what companies in Florida are doing or what companies in New Jersey are doing or California. What's the general consensus to the industry all over the country, not what somebody who's just writing about it is telling me, I want it straight from the source. So that's why I think I lean towards just reading LinkedIn. One thing about this industry and maybe it's just because that's the majority of the people I follow on LinkedIn, but they're very open.
They're not really hiding anything. They're just transparent with their business and their financials and their... It's like a community. And I know our Market President now, Todd Pugh, I know he's very transparent with us. And he's constantly talking to companies like east coast facilities or Loving Landscape or companies like that. They're constantly visiting each other and learning from each other.
And I think that's really cool that you're competitive, but at the same time that sharing and growing from each other, I think that's a really cool thing. And I just think that's what's special about this industry.
Abby Hart
 That's awesome. Is there any content that we can provide on Land One or Aspire that would really useful to you as an estimator or a designer? How did-
Chris Kline
 Yeah, I think as far as content... I think, again, I talk about reading things from around the industry, but it's mostly business owners. The Owners and the Presidents of those companies, sometimes it's the Controllers, like you had mentioned before, the guy you last spoke to.
But I would like to hear more from more estimators, more designers, how are you doing things? Maybe out of the box thinking, because I'm an outside of the box thinker. I don't box myself into what's the standard, this is what I'm going to do. If I can figure out way to do something and be more efficient, I'm going to do it. So I'd like to hear more of that from other estimators, other designers, and I'm sure if you asked our Field Supervisors, they'd tell you the same thing.
They want to hear more from other job Foremans or whatever you want to call them, Field Supervisor Foreman, just a little bit more of a personal connection would be nice too, because I don't see a lot of... There's a few estimators that I follow on there, a few design companies that I follow that I do keep up with, but besides showing off pictures of their designs that they're not really too much sharing how they do things. So I think that would be really good content for somebody in my position to read.
Abby Hart
 Given that it seems like you are a power user of Land One in your company and sounds like overall, given what Joshua has said about how you use it-
Chris Kline
 I'm really the only one to be honest with you. I've been pushing it and I keep trying to sell it to our maintenance guys. Like, ""I think this would be good. You know what I mean? I think you guys could use this."" And [inaudible 00:34:51] they love to be able to go on there on their iPad and create a quick design. And it's like, ""Hey, you can do that on Land One.""
So, I actually met here with Tom Ferguson is his name, he's our account manager for our Youngstown branch. And he sat here and we spent about an hour on Tuesday. And I gave him a crash course and he just hopped on my account and played around with it for a minute and I pulled up what he did, and I'm like, ""Oh man, I'm not a bad teacher.""
That's pretty cool to see, so I do see a potential and I told Joshua that I definitely see a potential in more people in Enviroscape using the program, but it's my primary pull. So I'm using it every day. And so, I guess I am in a sense.
Abby Hart
 Are there any other applications that you see for it that you think would be helpful for other estimators or designers to know about?
Chris Kline
 I guess just what I mentioned before with it being more of a design tool than just a takeoff program because I feel like that might be the label that it gets is, it's a takeoff program.
You're going to be able to find the square footage of that piece of lawn or that mulch bed or... But again, I like to push it to its limits and I like to try to design with it as much as possible. And I had told Joshua a while back, ""We need textures. We need those types of things. I need to be able to distinguish what's a rock bed from a mulch bed."" And within 2, 3 weeks, it was like, ""Oh, I have textures now.""
So it was really cool, and those types of advancements and things like that, I think that's what's really made it up its game a little bit to become more design program. There's still things I'd like to see, there's things I would like to pick his brain about and things of that nature. But I have no problem searching for items that I need, whether it be furniture, boards, things like that.
I find the images, I purchase them off Adobe and then I transfer them over to Land One and I use them within my designs. So I mean more options like that would be great. There's always room to improve for everybody, as well as a program. So those are things I've shared with him in the past. But like I said, I think there's optimal opportunity, especially here for a lot of use.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. Great. Okay, Chris, I think that we've pretty well covered my questions if I have any. What I'm going to do is I'll probably work on this over the next week. I'm hoping by the end of the week, I'll have a draft for you. Would you be able to email me your headshot and any design or something that I can use the blog post? That would be awesome. I don't know what you have access or what you think we should have permission to use, but-
Chris Kline
 You can use whatever. I don't covet anything that much. So I want to share, you know what I mean? I want people to see this is what you can do with it, so I can get some stuff together... Trying to think if I have a headshot. The last time we took pictures...
Abby Hart
 I know, I need to get mine done too, so I get it. So whatever you can send my way, I will have a draft for you hopefully at the end of the week, next week.
Chris Kline
 Yeah, and I mean, if there's anything that pops up from now, till then that you want to add, just shoot me an email. I'll give you [crosstalk 00:38:46]
Abby Hart
 Thank you so much, Chris.
Chris Kline
 No, thank you. I have a terrible sinus infection, so hopefully I made sense. I'm a little foggy.
Abby Hart
 You could not tell at all, but I will be in touch if I have any follow ups.
Chris Kline
 Okay. Awesome. Thank you so much.
Abby Hart
 Thanks so much, Chris, take care. Bye bye.
Chris Kline
 Bye."

 Okay. All right, Bryan. Let's just get right into the meat here. What's a controversial opinion you have about the landscape industry and how it uses technology?
Bryan Mours
 I don't feel that the landscape industry uses technology enough. We've grown up as an industry of paper and bar napkins and have had a very difficult time moving away from that, right? It's basically, I think a little bit of it do with the fact that I'm not in control anymore because if I built a spreadsheet, I know how it works because I put all the calculations into it. I don't want to throw away that spreadsheet and replace it with a piece of technology that can do that for me, right?
Bryan Mours
 The industry as a whole, I think, has been behind. But I blame technology a little bit in that because we haven't really brought technology to this industry, either. It's been way past due as far as bringing it to the industry, and so I can't blame the industry as a whole, because again, I think technology has been lagging in this industry because it's always been thought of just a bunch of guys with trucks and mowers that go out and cut grass and dig holes and they're not really business owners. Now that we have technology and are bringing it to the industry, I think people are starting to accept it, understand it, and bring it into their everyday business.
Abby Hart
 I guess, just as a related question, how do you think that software companies and the tech part of the landscape industry can help bridge the gap better between tech and these company owners?
Bryan Mours
 Yeah, knowledge, I think, is the biggest thing there, again, along with the technology not being available, there hasn't been a lot of, even from, let's go all the way down to the college level, we're working with universities now that are finally introducing technology into the classroom, right, in their horticulture classes. It's really getting people engaged in technology sooner and then being able to bring them, right, we're going to be bringing what's going to be called a ""community"" to our clients and to others that are interested in being part of Aspire. What that community is going to do is it's going to help educate people on the value of technology, right, and it can give you a tool to be able to better analyze your business through data so that you can make improvements, and obviously then drive a healthier bottom line.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. You just addressed this a little bit, but how does software have the potential to be a game-changer for landscaping businesses? I mean, by now, you've talked to so many landscapers, I mean, is there a story that you have in mind, or you can recall of where it was a real game-changer?
Bryan Mours
 Well, I could probably go off on my own experience. Actually, I was run running a landscape company back 2000, 2001. We bought, really, the only big ERP software that was available on the market for landscapers at the time, and we put it into our business processes, right? We started utilizing this software. Now, it took us a couple of years to really start utilizing it well, but we really took what we did by being able to analyze the data and create business processes.
Bryan Mours
 One thing about technology as a tool is that it's just that, it's a tool, and you got to build good processes around that tool, and so by having the tool in place, we were able to build good processes and run more effectively and efficient in our business and then analyze the data and understand where we need to needed to make improvements. We brought our company from three to 4% net profit up above 15% net profit every year and so it was a game-changer, right? I mean, being able to turn that kind of money around. Again, it was just because we were able to see data and analyze it and create good, efficient processes.
Bryan Mours
 One of the companies that I just talked to one of the owners of the comp of a company that's on Aspire about a month or so ago and one of the comments he said to me was, and I've known this person for a long, long time, one of the comments he said to me was, ""Bryan, I never thought I would be giving away a quarter of a million dollars to my employees at the end of the year because of how much profit in profit sharing because of how much profit we've made. Thank you so much, Aspire, for helping us do this."" Think about the number of people's lives that changed, right? It not only changed the company owner's life, but he's able to change the lives of all of his employees because think about the bonuses they all received at the end of the year, and were able to go buy cars and put away money for college funds for the kids and things of that nature, so it can be a game-changer.
Abby Hart
 Can I use that story, Bryan?
Bryan Mours
 Sure. Yeah, absolutely.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. That's awesome. I mean, that's incredible. Let's get Aspire-specific here, I guess. What's a common misconception that people have about Aspire? I guess let's start with Aspire first, or I mean, whichever you think, just using software in general, or Aspire in particular, what's a common misconception that people have about fear of using software to run businesses?
Bryan Mours
 Well, I kind of alluded to it and it's the fact that software is going to replace everything, right, meaning it's going to open the door for me on the way in, it's going to make my ham sandwich for lunch, it's going to drive my car home for me, and so once I get software in place, my job is over.
Bryan Mours
 One of the funny things that people say to me is, ""Why doesn't the software notify my people that they have work to do?"" I'm like, ""Well, how did you inform your people before you had the software?"" They're like, ""Well, we'd walk out to the shop, and I'd talk to my people,"" and I go, ""We just keep doing that."" Software isn't eliminating human communication and the need for human intervention and humans to be a part of the day-to-day activity. People think that the software is replacing everything, right? Again, if I buy a person a shovel, but they don't know how to use that shovel, they don't have a good process to run that shovel, right, that tree that's sitting over there that needs to go in a hole in the ground may never get in the hole in the ground and it's going to die, and so software tends to die if people don't understand. It's just a tool that I have to build good processes around to utilize, right, and to make my company more profitable or more efficient.
Abby Hart
 That's great. I guess this is kind of related to the story you told earlier, what kinds of reactions have you gotten from companies that have switched to Aspire about the impact on their business, and what's different for them now?
Bryan Mours
 Yeah, it's twofold because the initial reaction is, ""Wow, this is hard,"" right? But I think about when you think about professional athletes and what they go through to become a professional athlete all through life, it's years and years and years of dedication and training and doing things, and yeah, it's hard. It's hard a lot of times and you want to quit, so people initially, they get on our software and they go, ""Wow, this is hard. I'm not seeing any results."" As I mentioned, in my own experience, it took us about two years to really get good at using the software. I tell people, ""Really, 12 to 18 months, don't expect any change in your company and expect to have a lot of work to do, right, because it's change management, you're changing how you do things at your company.""
Bryan Mours
 Usually, it's kind of that I can almost tell you exactly when somebody's going to start turning the corner, but once they reach that 18-month mark or that two-year mark and they start seeing the data and they're able to kind of go out to their crews and say, ""Hey, we're not being very efficient,"" or they're looking at clients and going, ""God, we're losing money on these clients,"" and, ""I'm going to fire a few of these clients,"" or, ""I'm going to increase their prices,"" that's when they really start to see the positive things within their company.
Bryan Mours
 The reaction has been, as I mentioned in the other story about not ever imagining he was going to be giving that money away, it's all over the map, right? We have allowed companies to not only just grow organically, but grow to such a point where they can now be acquiring other companies to be building bigger businesses and to be employing more people. It's really fascinating because the reaction I get from people, and I know a lot of our clients personally, they're just over the top, just happy that they committed to this and they stuck with it because now they're seeing the results of the labor. That's the way it always is, right? In life, nothing comes easy. If you work hard at something, you're going to reap the rewards from it.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Can you talk a little bit about how software gives, or how Aspire in particular gives people an edge over their competitors?
Bryan Mours
 I'm going to go with the data because again, what data does is it allows you the ability to make corrections within your company. What that does is that allows you to be better than your competition, right? The guy that's just flying by the seat of his pants and just going out there and pricing based upon no knowledge of data and he's losing money, he's either going to be out of business, right, in a few years because he doesn't have the data to run his company, and/or he's not going to be selling any jobs, right? His quality is going to suffer because he's going to try to underbid and then run his crews.
Bryan Mours
 What it does is it allows people to be able to, again, take data, improve their business, and know that they're selling jobs where they can provide a level of quality to those jobs, right, because anyone can bid a job at, ""It'd take me two hours to mow that 10-acre property."" Well, if I do it in two hours, it's going to look like heck. If I do it in the proper amount of time, 10 hours, it's going to look beautiful. Providing something, not only just, again, at a decent price to people, which again, by analyzing how well you're performing at your business, you can provide a fair price for a very great value, right, because I'm going to be providing a high-quality product in the end.
Abby Hart
 Great. One thing I don't think that we... I mentioned in this creative brief, potential angles or value props to touch on, kind of how Aspire goes above and beyond with the implementation process and guidance from people in the know. Can you talk a little bit more about, I mean, those two things, how implementation works, how it's better, how that's a differentiator, and also how our team helps people be better, and anything else that you think that we should add to this, or discuss? Yeah.
Bryan Mours
 One of the things I think that's important from our implementation team that we've always kind of focused on is hiring people that have been in the industry, and not the software industry, the landscaping industry, and so it's really in that early stage of learning the software that it's nice to talk with somebody that knows the lingo, that knows, again, the struggles that you're going through, and to be able to walk you through, talk you through, again, how you need to bring your business onto this new platform. It's always been my...
Bryan Mours
 I think we differentiate ourselves in that fashion, right? A lot of people, a lot of software companies hire implementation people, but they're not from the industry that they're selling in the software chain. That becomes difficult, right, because then it becomes more boilerplate, then it becomes specialized. That's where I think, oddly enough, I've probably personally trained about 500 companies on our software and other software. That's 500 companies that do things differently. Oddly enough, they're all in the same industry. By being able to understand the implementation team can kind of adjust their training to adapt to how that client does things, right, and how they want to set up their system because a lot of the setup is on them to do.
Bryan Mours
 From there, right, then we have our full care reactive support group, which is always important to a good software system because of the fact that, right, there's issues, there's questions that people have, and they want to have a go-to person to get that information from or to be able to help them quickly, and so our support team isn't second to anyone in this because of the fact that we train these people, not only understand the software, but to understand the industry, it's hard to hire everyone from the landscape industry, and so there's a certain amount of knowledge that we pass along, and having so many people within the industry, we do that, we have a regular training that people go through to learn not the software, but the industry. think that's important.
Bryan Mours
 -The other thing is, I mentioned this earlier, is this whole idea of implementation teaches a little bit about the tool and how to use the tool. What our CSM team teaches is how to build proper processes around the tool. When they do graduate from implementation, they start working on a regular cadence with their client success manager. It's in that time that people, and that's why I say it's not a three-month process that's implementation, it's an 18-month process to really get to where you're utilizing the tool well, and that's in that work that you're doing with the CSM team, because it's building the processes around the tool. Those are the things that we do that I think sets us way above a lot of other companies out there in this space or any space that are selling software.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Okay. What do the most successful landscape companies get right about their approach to software and technology? Then how does that reflect in their profits, revenue, growth, culture? I mean, it's just funny, I'm saying these questions out loud, and I mean, you're addressing these things, but yeah. Yeah, so what do the most successful landscape companies get right about their approach to software and tech?
Bryan Mours
 The fact that they're going to have to change their business, that's probably the biggest one. I know I've mentioned this, is the owner that has a spreadsheet and he holds it like is blanky at night, right, he doesn't want to give it up, we've actually joked with owners about that, ""All right, give me the blanky. I'm going to throw it in the fireplace and you're not going to use it anymore."" It's really the companies that are successful are the ones that are open to change because we've worked with so many companies that have said, ""I want your software to do it this way."" Well, that's the way their old software did it, or they've done it for years and years and years, right? There's so many companies that have failed. Kodak, IBM almost failed because they got ignorant to the fact that they shouldn't change what they're doing, right? They just keep running things status quo. Well, status quo doesn't make you better.
Bryan Mours
 If people accept the fact that they need to change and they need to adapt, right? No software, including Aspire, is built for an individual user, and so our software does this, and so you need to change the way you run your company around, again, the software, because of the fact that the software, it's very rigid, so to speak, and again, if you're not open to change, it's going to be very difficult to get your company utilizing the software well.
Abby Hart
 Can you, I guess, get a little more specific about an ideal ...? I mean, you probably have a ton of examples in your brain of who the most successful Aspire users are and how they've been able to change their profits. Can you talk a little bit more in-depth about, because we've talked about profits and revenue, can we talk a little bit more about growth and culture, I guess, when it comes to successful landscape companies who use Aspire, or technology in general well?
Bryan Mours
 Yeah, I mean, like you said, there's hundreds of examples of companies that have used it well. One company in particular is that they have a model of no ticket left behind, which because we're ticket management system, in order to really be on providing the level of work on time, and then invoicing that work in a timely fashion for your jobs, right, you got to manage those work tickets well, and so this company, and they have this sign posted everywhere in their shop, ""No ticket left behind."" By doing that, what they're doing is they're creating good processes within their company around the quintessential piece of the software and that is the work ticket. If I manage that work ticket well, I'm going to be, I'm going to hit my margins, which means I'm going to be able to pay my expenses and I'm going to have profitability.
Bryan Mours
 It means I'm going to be able to invoice in a timely fashion, which means my cashflow is going to be good, right, which is always, for whatever reason, our industry doesn't invoice, right, and so they're always wondering how they're going to pay their bills when they don't have any money, but yet, if you look in their AR report, they got a half a million dollars in accounts receivable, or they have a half a million dollars in unbilled work, and so it's like get the work billed and collect your money, right? Those are two biggest things.
Bryan Mours
 Our system is built on a workflow, right? As long as you follow that workflow all the way through and do it right in a timely fashion, and we kind of red flag you, right, when something falls into invoice and just says, ""It's time to invoice it,"" right? Don't let it sit there for 30 or 60 days, invoice it, get the invoice to the customer so you can have positive cashflow so you can pay your bills, and so again, your payroll's covered, all these good things.
Bryan Mours
 Some other examples are the crew, the production managers, we have one particular client that took their enhancement sales because their production managers were able to utilize tools within the system, like issues and the site audit capability, and they were able to bring more information back to the account managers from the field so that the account help managers can go, ""Oh, they need a new plant. They have a dead plant. They need a replacement plant.""
Bryan Mours
 What people were able to do is by being able to manage their properties better through the software, they were able to increase the amount of, not only maintenance work that they were doing, but enhancement work they were doing. Again, just bringing in, just utilizing the different pieces or the different tools within the software to increase the amount of sales that they were using, and again, I could go on and on with different stories, but it's really about, again, understanding how the software is built, what the important things are, and how to manage those things, and again, the work ticket is the most important piece. If you manage work tickets, the software is going to do wonders for you.
Abby Hart
 Great. Can you talk about where Aspire is aiming to take the solution? This could be, I mean, you could discuss anything from product launches or integrations, or possibly address the acquisition by ServiceTitan, I mean, anything that you think is worth discussing in this Q&A.
Bryan Mours
 Yeah, I think what we're trying to do is we want... Part of my job is getting people, or getting partners engaged in creating a ecosystem, right? Part of the ecosystem is adding quality partners, which means I don't necessarily have to go out and shop for a payroll company because we have a payroll provider that is going to provide the same quality of product and the same quality of service that Aspire provides. By allowing people to have these different integration partners that all link into Aspire, again, it minimizes the amount of manual work they need to do with their companies because if they have a payroll service that doesn't integrate with Aspire, it now becomes more of a manual process to get employees from this system into this system.
Bryan Mours
 We're going to be building a community where people can interact with one another. We're going to have LMS systems out in this community where people can learn and improve the way they not only run their business on the software, but run their business in general. We're going to offer interaction with ServiceTitan on that same community, right, so if I want to talk to somebody in heating and air conditioning about maybe how they're running their business, and some of the things that they can provide me as far as advice and running my business better, right, it doesn't matter what business you're in, if you're in the service industry, it's pretty much similar across the board, and so we're going to give people access to all these resources to ask questions and involve themselves with people. We're partnering with the best consultants in the landscape industry and these partners are helping us to train client on better processes and way they run their business. Those things are all happening and we're going to bring those partners into the community as well, those consulting partners.
Bryan Mours
 One great thing about the partnership with ServiceTitan is the addition of resources, right? In order for us to be the leader that's out there for the landscape industry, and that's what our original vision was, was how do we change the industry, how do we become the leader of the industry, right? By providing not only a software, but information for people to run their businesses better, right? The consulting partners, the ecosystem, which is going to be very high-level partners that provide the same quality service or product that we do.
Bryan Mours
 But then again, also this idea that we're going to have more resources to develop the product, right, to be able to support the product, to build the community. That's what ServiceTitan brings, right? ServiceTitan brings knowledge because they have a lot of knowledge and what they've developed in their software and resources, right? They can bring people, money, knowledge to us to help us understand how we can do things better.
Bryan Mours
 I think our roadmap is, though I know a lot about what we're doing this year, the roadmap, it really is, it's a moving target, so to speak, meaning we're always looking to boldly innovate, right? That's one of our core values. We're always looking to boldly innovate. One of the things that we did at last year's client conference was we had an expert panel of robotic mower manufacturers, right? Okay, right, we're talking to those people about how we're going to integrate that into Aspire, right? Drones, right? We're talking to drone companies, how are we going to integrate that knowledge into Aspire?
Bryan Mours
 Ultimately, what we're working to build is this system that people can run their business, they can have partners that can provide those other services that Aspire doesn't provide, but at the same level of quality that we provide, and as well, provide everyone with education. As I mentioned, knowledge is one of the biggest things that people are looking for in this industry. I was just on a call earlier today, a pricing call with a company that really had never thought about how to set their pricing in a software system before because they never had a software system, and so I was able to bring them knowledge, but we want to do that from a greater respect so that Bryan doesn't have to be on a call every day with somebody, but I was able to bring them knowledge that they didn't have before, and now they can go out and they can set their pricing, understand how to review their pricing from the data, and then make those improvements next year in the software so that they can be a more profitable, better-run company. I hope that answered the question.
Abby Hart
 That does answer the question, Bryan. That just brought another question to my mind. We've talked a lot about other companies that are using disconnected processes and want the blanky of their spreadsheets, which I think is phenomenal, and I will definitely include, but what about the companies that are already kicking butt with Aspire that are just so savvy? A lot of the companies that spoke and were kind of those client-advisors that were presenting alongside our people at the client conference, what value can Aspire continue to bring those people? Because obviously, we're running the gamut, from people who've never used the software before to people who are killing it with Aspire, so yeah, now I'm just curious, how is Aspire continuing to add value for those people?
Bryan Mours
 I think one of the biggest ways we're adding value for those people is we're never stopping as far as the improvements/additions to our product, right? There's always going to be new, different, safe, more effective ways for people to use their software, and it's really where we get the input in all of this, of course, is the people that are using it every day, right? Those people that you saw is that were in front of classrooms are up and doing the expert panel that were from companies that do utilize the system well, but they're also providing us the input that we're taking and going, ""Okay, yeah, if we add that improvement to our software, it's going to create a more effective, more efficient process when doing this,"" right? We're always looking for better ways to improve our software.
Bryan Mours
 I think that's where the community is going to be huge is because, and quite frankly, I was shocked, when we did the expert panel on the last day of the client conference, I brought up the best of the best from the companies across the country. When we asked them a question, ""How much of the software do you feel like you're truly utilizing today?"", I think the highest number we got from somebody was 60%. I was like, ""Oh, my God, we have to do better."" The problem is these people have a difficult time, right, bringing the product down to the next level and to the next level and so to get to 60 to 70% is a lot, right? Quite frankly, if you're using it 60 to 70%, you're probably utilizing it extremely well to run your company.
Bryan Mours
 But we also have tools in there, like the equipment module, the site audit tools, the budgeting tool, a lot of different tools that people don't get to within those first two, three years, because again, they're just working to get a company of 200 people utilizing this software well, and that's the way we train it. We say, ""Learn the basics and then expand out from there,"" so those people know they have more to bring to their company. The problem is the more we add on, right, sometimes they're falling further and further behind, so there's a lot for these people to learn and implement within their companies that is currently in the software, and that will continue to add to our software as we move forward.
Bryan Mours
 One of the things that one of the owners used to say was, ""Today, you're buying a Yugo. Tomorrow, you're going to own a Cadillac,"" right, because of what we're doing to the so software, right? If I think about the first client I trained on Aspire a little over seven years ago now, it's nothing compared to what the software is today. Some of the people that we brought on to the software, you're kind of like, you're scratching your head going, ""Boy, they loved our software back then. The people today should just be thrilled with our software because it's so much bigger,"" but bigger isn't always better, right? Sometimes it's best to try to just keep things simple and not add so many bells and whistles, which is why sometimes integrating with partners is a better option.
Bryan Mours
 Even with the things ServiceTitan is doing, right, we have Marketing Pro that's going to be integrated with our software. They're going to have Fleet Pro. They have a lot of different Pro products, which is going to give people the option to, and again, they can either buy it or not buy it, and if they buy it's going to integrate with the software. But again, it becomes not necessarily learning of this software because I built it inside Aspire, but now, I just have to learn another piece, and maybe I just get my two marketing people to learn Marketing Pro, right, and so I can specialize people in certain areas by maybe not having it built into the software, but integrating it through different partners.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. Bryan, this is great. Is there anything else that you, that we didn't touch on that you think that we need to talk about here?
Bryan Mours
 I don't think so. I think we were pretty thorough in a lot of that.
Abby Hart
 I think so, too. You gave me so much information in 45 minutes. I'm going to have to cut this down by like 90%.
Bryan Mours
 Sift through it, get rid of the crap.
Abby Hart
 I will get this transcribed. Yeah, before I send this off to design, obviously, I'll have you read the interview and make sure that we're all clear there, but thank you so much for your time, Bryan. I know how busy you are.
Bryan Mours
 All right, Abby. You bet.
Abby Hart
 All right, take care.
Bryan Mours
 Always happy to help. Take care.
Abby Hart
 Fantastic. Thanks so much. Bye-bye.
Bryan Mours
 Yep, bye."

 I'm going to record you on my phone, so I have everything correct. Okay. So they wanted me to pick your brain about Crew Control, because you are the subject matter expert I've been told. So, why don't we just start there? So, why don't you give me a little bit of background about yourself and how Crew Control came to be?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah, absolutely. What's the audience for this? Is this just for your knowledge, or is this getting written up somehow?
Diana Lamirand
 My understanding is that we are going to take this information I get from you and I'm going to create probably it looks like three blogs out of it. One of them is going to be why we set out to create Crew Control. And then the other one is about how to create scheduling in Crew Control.
And then the third one was supposed to be about why is it important for growing contractors to have a solution for sending proposals electronically, which I know is part of the up the tiered level of Crew Control, the $50 month version, right?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah.
Diana Lamirand
 That's what you get with that? Okay. That's basically my understanding. I'm writing blogs for Aspire.
David Vroblesky
 Okay.
Diana Lamirand
 Who is part of ServiceTitan, and I'm a contractor with ServiceTitan.
David Vroblesky
 Okay. Well, I'll just give you a lot of information then it sounds like, and you can just chime in if you have more questions or if you want to circle back to those key topics as well.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 Then I can add some more context later.
Diana Lamirand
 Wonderful.
David Vroblesky
 Yeah. So I grew up working in a combination of the trades and software. So I had my own landscaping company in high school. I did summers landscaping in college, but I've also worked for two different HVAC companies and a pressure washing and window cleaning company. So I've worked a little bit in the trades and had some hands-on experience there.
And then I worked in software for about eight years for building nonprofit software. But my friend Daniel, and I always thought that we would like to build a product together. And we both gravitated towards the trades, because we felt like there was an opportunity there to create a very simple and easy to use software.
So it was in May 2018, I was chatting with my Uncle Rick, who owns a lawn landscape maintenance company and tree removal business up in Maryland. And I was just interviewing him to see if there was any opportunities to help him out. And one of the questions I asked him was, what keeps you up at night? And I heard him say millennials and how they never want to work and all that kind of stuff, and rambling on.
And then he said weather, and then he started to move on. And that triggered something in my mind that I wasn't expecting. So I asked him to explain that a little bit more. When he did, it made a lot of sense. He basically said that with his lawn maintenance, it's high volume, low margin work. So they're doing a lot of jobs per day. They don't make a lot of money per job. So they basically are maxing out each day on the schedule.
And because they're maxing out each day and it's outdoor work, when bad weather happens, like high winds or rain, and they can't do the work, he has to figure out how to juggle all that work across the week and see if he can get it done. And his process for scheduling involved a Manila folder for each day of the month and an index card for each customer. Very manual, and it worked really well when everything worked perfectly.
But when weather happened, he had to move things around because you can imagine that it was pretty complicated to figure out, okay, this job was supposed to happen on Monday, but it's raining today. Can it go to Tuesday? But Tuesday's already booked out. Is it close to the jobs on Tuesday? How do I make sure my guys aren't driving all around town?
So as soon as I heard him describe that problem, a light bulb went off of in my head. And I was like, ""I wonder if other people similar to Uncle Rick are having this problem."" And I saw that there are a large number of lawn and landscaping companies out there and a lot of them are on the smaller side. And there wasn't a lot of solutions at the time, maybe even now, that are really meeting them in a good way.
So I started interviewing all the people I could talk to in the industry. I started reaching out to some of my friends. I started talking to random landscapers who were working around my house or nearby, getting their thoughts on how they were doing things. I did Google Ads, I went to trade shows and just started building Crew Control.
We started with just this basic framework of, let's give you a really easy way to enter your schedule. And then with the click of a button, we'll optimize the routes for you on that day to the most efficient driving route. And we'll make it really easy for you to adjust the schedule. That's how we started, with just basic route optimization where you could put your jobs in, you could click a button.
We'd optimize them to the best driving route for that day and then we would give you a printed schedule for your crew, so you could give it to them. So they could go to each job and write in when they got there and when they left. That was our basic approach.
Diana Lamirand
 Was that integrated through GPS? Is that how you handled that?
David Vroblesky
 Through the route optimization?
Diana Lamirand
 Yes.
David Vroblesky
 We used some of Google's logic in the backend to help figure out typical traffic conditions and things like that, and figure out what the best driving route was.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 And then we started with just a printed schedule, just something really basic to get out there. And we got some good feedback on it, but we also got feedback that it would be great if we could give the crews an option to clock in and out on their mobile phones, instead of writing on a piece of paper, because that's how a lot of these companies operate. If they don't use software, they'll use these paper route sheets.
And sometimes crews can fudge numbers or they forget what time they got there. They're pulling back into the shop at the end of the day and they're like, ""I'm going to try to remember when I got to all these jobs."" And that date is important because how long you're spending on a job is a big factor in how much money you're spending, what your costs are for that job as a business owner.
And a lot of these companies don't know how much time they're spending, so they don't know whether they're making or losing money on the job, because they don't know how much time they're spending.
Diana Lamirand
 Right.
David Vroblesky
 Because with maintenance, time is the big factor, your labor cost. So our next iteration of Crew Control was to go ahead and give crews a simple way to clock in and clock out on their phone. And we just gave them a digital ... We called it our digital route sheet and it gets texted to them every day, so they don't even need to download a map or anything.
Diana Lamirand
 Yeah.
David Vroblesky
 It's a daily text message with a link to their route sheet for the day. And there's just a big green button that says start and a big red button that says stop. It would just track their time and it was just basic, easy for the crews. It was in Spanish and English, and it would track their time. So now, we had easy scheduling, we had route optimization, and now we had a digital route sheet for the crews on their phone.
And then from there, we just started getting it out there, growing the business, getting more feedback from our users, and really making changes really quickly. We got our first paying customer in January 2019. So it wasn't that long ago. And we were really trying to build the best product we can. There were a couple times where users would suggest a change to the product and it made a lot of sense.
It was kind of an obvious thing, and we'd roll out the update the same day that they made the suggestion. And that was why with people we were trying to move really quickly. Just trying to create the best product we can. And then we started adding on more features, like the ability to have a checklist on a job. So if you want crews to do certain things, they have to check off certain items.
We added an option where crews could upload videos and photos from their phone when they're on the job. And then the admins could see that information coming back in. And then we added in reporting, so you could see whether you're making or losing money on jobs. That's our basic, how we first got going.
And early on, we were trying to decide, are we going to be a scheduling product for a lot of different trades? We have people all over the place exploring our product. Used car dealerships were scheduling test drives. Pilot car services for oversights loads, porta potty companies for their cleaning schedules, meal delivery services like Meals on Wheels.
So we had all sorts of people exploring our product, and ultimately we decided we wanted to be really good at something before we expanded out to be scheduling for a lot of people. That's why early on, we focused on lawn maintenance specifically.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. So lawn maintenance as opposed to landscaping in general, right?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah, at least initially. That was our first pass of, ""Hey, here's our target customer."" They're either just starting out or maybe low million in revenue per year. They want something that's affordable, easy to use, but helps them understand whether they're making or losing money, helps them make sure that nothing slips through the cracks with their schedules, stay organized. That was our initial customer, although we've expanded out a lot since then.
I just saw today, we had a new customer sign up that does equipment rental. And they have 13 different, I guess, rental facilities now that are running on Crew Control. So all sorts of people. We have cleaning companies. We have irrigation, fertilizer application, horse mowing, tree removal, outdoor lighting, Christmas tree delivery, all sorts of stuff. And in addition to helping with scheduling route optimization and crew tracking, we also do their billing for them, and we can do proposals as well.
Diana Lamirand
 Awesome. And then as far as the cleaning companies, that goes back to the janitorial services? Is that what you're referring to there? Okay.
David Vroblesky
 Yep, that's right.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. And so Crew Control is being used by many companies, not just landscaping. It's all these other ones that you just mentioned are using it?
David Vroblesky
 Yep.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. Great.
David Vroblesky
 Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. And one of the reasons why we wanted to launch Crew Control was to offer the power of technology to people who may not be that tech savvy, people who aren't on the leading edge of all of the computers and technology out there. But we wanted to bring that to them in a very easy, approachable way. One click of a button and we optimize their route for them.
Versus there might be other products out there that do route optimization, but they may not be simple enough for some of these people to even know about or go out and find and be able to figure out, where ours just meets them where they're at. They don't need to change their business. They can run it the same way they're doing it today in the same order, but we add additional tools that they can take advantage of. But they don't have to set it up.
We offer a 14-day free trial, so no credit card up front. They just go to the website, can try it out for free for two weeks. And within the first day of signing up, they can already have their schedule built out and ready to go for their crews.
Diana Lamirand
 So when they go on this 14-day trial, you just say they go online and sign up. So, there's no implementation or integration, or anything that has to happen on the backend for-
David Vroblesky
 Yep.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 Yep, that's right. Yep.
Diana Lamirand
 How does it work exactly? If I was a landscape company and I went to go do this 14-day trial, I just click a button and it starts messing with my system? How does it work?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah. You just get to our website, crewcontrol.com, you can learn more about our solution. And then there's a button there to start your trial, where we go ahead and ask you for a little bit of information, like the name of your company, your phone number, your office location so we can set up your routing for you.
And then you go ahead and log into your system. You create your own password basically too, to log into your system. And then you're in your system. You get all the capabilities until your trial is over. And then you'll have to decide whether or not you want to continue on and sign up or not.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. And also it seems like it's more affordable than some of the software solutions I've seen.
David Vroblesky
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yep, we have two packages, Crew Control Standard and Crew Control Plus. We bill based on the number of crews that you're running, and you can add or remove crews at any time too and it changes your pricing. And that's $30 a month per crew for our standard package and $50 a month per crew for our plus package.
Diana Lamirand
 And so, what would you say the customers that are using this, what's the average crew number as far as when they decide to start with you guys?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah. Most of our customers are running three crews or less. It's like 70% of our customers probably are running three crews or less.
Diana Lamirand
 And a typical crew-
David Vroblesky
 A lot of those are running one or two crews. Sorry, say that one more time?
Diana Lamirand
 A typical crew is how many people?
David Vroblesky
 It depends on the service industry. For janitorial, it might be one or two, versus for lawn care maintenance, it might be two to four or something like that.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. But most of them have about three to four crews?
David Vroblesky
 Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 Yeah, three crews or less. Although, we do have some customers who are running who have 20 crews and up there, but most of our customers are running three crews or less.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. And before you go on, so explain to me how ... I know that Crew Control, they sold this to me as an Aspire light version. This is what you can get with Crew Control, but it doesn't cost as much as Aspire and you don't get it. What's the difference? How does it work with Aspire and what do they get versus the other?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah. Aspire is more of a full featured business management software. It will run your business for you. It will tell you how much to charge for things, your profitability, help you with tracking materials. And it's got a lot more enterprise level capabilities. Crew Control is a light business management system.
Crew Control is not going to tell you how much to charge for jobs. It's going to help you know how much money you're making per job, but it's not going to have a framework to set your business up. It'll more meet you where you're at, help you stay organized, better communicate with your crews, track your hours and get paid faster through billing.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. That makes sense.
David Vroblesky
 And with Aspire, you go through implementation with consultants, who are best practice industry experts who will help you set it up well. And you get a lot more hand holding. With Crew Control, it's pretty hands off. We have support if you need it, but you log into your free trial, get up and running by yourself, unless you need help. Versus Aspire, it's like a full implementation as well, with a lot more help.
Diana Lamirand
 All right. So you say you launched this in 2019, so we're two years in. So tell me the before and after for ... Sorry, Kim just answered me.
David Vroblesky
 No problem.
Diana Lamirand
 The before and after for Crew Control as far as where you started. How many customers are you at and what's the revenue look like? Just give me some kind of background information about the actual product.
David Vroblesky
 Yeah. And obviously, you want to be careful how much information you share about that externally.
Diana Lamirand
 Got it. Yeah.
David Vroblesky
 We got our first customer in January 2019. And let me just pull this up real quick because I have some of this data already. It took us 17 months to get our first 10 customers.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 And really, I was working nights and weekends. Crew Control was a side project, until I went full-time. And then it took us another 14 months to get our first 100 customers. And then it only took us another five months to get our next 100 customers.
Diana Lamirand
 Nice. Okay.
David Vroblesky
 So we're definitely growing. We have about 250 companies using it right now, but we've added like 50 this year alone. So we're starting to ramp up with our growth.
Diana Lamirand
 So of those 250, how would you break them down as far as industry goes, as far as like 50% landscapers?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah. It's probably a little over half or maybe 70% landscapers, and then the rest is a combination of janitorial, delivery services, HVAC, pest control.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. Wonderful.
David Vroblesky
 Yeah.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 Yep.
Diana Lamirand
 All right. As far as the way it actually works, as far as creating the schedules, I know you talked about this a little bit, but walk me through that. So I sign up and I want to improve my scheduling. I saw that it's color coded on the video I saw. So Kim mentioned that you might have some videos that you could share with me for some of these blogs too, as far as how they work.
David Vroblesky
 Yeah, definitely. Yeah. And we have a YouTube channel, I think, with some good videos. You can search out some of that.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. I'll get it.
David Vroblesky
 If you Google Crew Control proposals, there's a nice video we had.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 Crew Control payments.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 But it's really simple when you get into your trial. You can go ahead and add your jobs, either click add recurring jobs or add one-time job. Recurring jobs happen on a regular basis, like every week, like for mowing. And one-time jobs are just like it says, it's only happening typically one time.
If you have QuickBooks Online, we do integrate with QuickBooks. You can go ahead and link that during your trial and then we'll pull your customer information over so you don't have to add it again. But you'll go through and start building out your schedule, getting it on the books. You can even use our route optimization if you want to change things around a little bit, and then dispatch it to your crew.
I like to use the crawl, walk, run methodology of you don't have to do everything at once. Crew Control is very basic. Even our most advanced capabilities are easy to use. You don't have to use all of them at once. So start, that's the crawl. Just get your job scheduled, dispatch them to your crew, and get your crews using that digital route sheet to clock in and out. That's at the most basic level. You'll start to collect more data on how long you're spending on jobs.
And then walking from that, a little more advanced would be, start to give your crews more instructions for the jobs. Start to type in instructions that they can see, gate codes, maybe checklist items of materials they need or things they need to do. You can upload photos of the property, and then get the crews into the same thing. Maybe you can start collecting details and notes from them.
How many charge of mulch did they use? What color? Were there any issues on the property that they wanted to take a photo of? So you can go ahead and have that for your records. Improve that communication, and then start to use that data to run reports and better understand your business, and then do your billing as well through Crew Control.
Because with Crew Control, you can text invoices, you can securely store payment methods for customers, like cards and bank accounts. You can auto charge them if you have their permission. And really, just try to optimize your workflow of getting jobs scheduled, getting data from your crew, and getting them billed. A little more advanced from that, like I said, you don't have to use all these at once, is to start using our proposals as well.
So Crew Control allows you to create lightweight proposals, so you can sell work more easily too. A lot of companies out there have Word templates and other documents that they use. I talked to one the other week who is using Carbon Copy. So they're creating these proposals for new work manually, and then they actually have to get the customer to be manually agree to those, before they can get them scheduled.
With Crew Control, you can easily electronically send proposals to clients via text or email, and the customers can electronically accept those. And then you can schedule the work off of it. So it's just a little more efficient to get that information out to your customers quicker. You don't have to use paper. You have a good audit trail of it. And we'll pre-populate some of the details when you schedule the job. That's a piece of it.
We can also use Crew Control to do customer communication. If you want to text customers automatically the day of their visit, or after their visit is complete, or when it rains, you can do that through Crew Control. And then you can also do payroll time tracking to track your employee hours for payroll too. So those are more advanced features, but you don't have to use that right out the gate. Go ahead and just get your basic schedule, get your crews clocking in and out of the phone and start using it.
Diana Lamirand
 So, is that how basically that Crew Control works as far as the texts themselves? Do you need to have iPads available for them, or they just can use their smartphones and do it that way? Or what's the hardware picture look like?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah, really anything with cellular connectivity so we can get that text or email. So it could be a tablet. We have customers who like to use tablets for it. Or it could be a crew leader's phone, where each crew leader has their own work phone that you're texting that to each day. Which you can also text it manually or have it text automatically on schedule, like at 6:00 AM every morning.
Or you could text it to their personal phone as well. I would recommend you look at sort of law regulation around that, because sometimes if you have people use personal phones for work, you might want to do some reimbursement or something for their data.
Diana Lamirand
 Right. But as far as them using it to clock in and out, how would they do that? If it was sent to the Crew Control supervisor, how would they do that?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah, it's really light. You just click clock in and you click clock out. I can actually send an example to your phone if you want to see how it works.
Diana Lamirand
 Sure.
David Vroblesky
 Yeah. What's your phone number?
Diana Lamirand
 317-294-2972.
David Vroblesky
 That's 317-394-2972?
Diana Lamirand
 No, 294-2972.
David Vroblesky
 Okay. Perfect. Okay. Yeah. So act like you're the crew leader.
Diana Lamirand
 All right.
David Vroblesky
 And you should get a text message here in a moment.
Diana Lamirand
 There it is.
David Vroblesky
 And do you see how it has a clock in and clock out at the top? That's for payroll. That's an optional thing you can turn on.
Diana Lamirand
 I get that.
David Vroblesky
 Or do you see how you have a list of jobs for that day?
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. Gotcha.
David Vroblesky
 And each job you can click on and they can clock in.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. But I guess what I was trying to get to was it seems like they would have to have some kind of personal device to be able to do this themselves. Are you going to depend on your supervisor to clock you in and out? I guess you could, but I don't know.
David Vroblesky
 Yeah. That's how the model works today, is you typically would have a crew leader who's managing the Crew Control schedule for the day.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 They're clocking in and out of the jobs. It could be a personal phone, a work phone, or a tablet.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. All right. Sounds good.
David Vroblesky
 It's really just a webpage that's getting delivered via text or email. So it's pretty light.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 You don't need to download an app or anything like that.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. Sounds good. Now, as far as the dispatching part of it too, so I was curious about that. This particular service is not a dispatching service. You're just communicating the information and the dispatcher needs to take it from there. Or is it online somehow?
David Vroblesky
 What do you mean by dispatching service?
Diana Lamirand
 Well, I mean dispatching. Some of the companies that we do work for, they are actually texting and emailing. And the dispatching, they're all communicating electronically. You don't have to call into the dispatcher and get the information. It gets sent to them, they get the route, and they get the job and everything. And they just have to look online or look on their text message and say, ""Okay, here's where I'm going"" and that kind of thing.
David Vroblesky
 Yeah, that's how our works.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 I just dispatched it to you. You got a link to your schedule with all your jobs.
Diana Lamirand
 That's the dispatching? Okay.
David Vroblesky
 All in there. Yep, that's the dispatch. Yep, that's right.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. All right. All right. That makes sense. I think the video, it seems like I said, the job in progress is blue and if it's complete it's green. So it's color coded kind of thing?
David Vroblesky
 Yep, that's right.
Diana Lamirand
 Are there any other colors that come up?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah. You probably don't need to speak to them that much, but yellow is if it's paused, like for lunch or something like that.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 Orange is if it's skipped for the day.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. And red's canceled?
David Vroblesky
 Canceled just isn't on the schedule.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. Gotcha. All right.
David Vroblesky
 We do show alerts sometimes. If the crew uploads a photo or adds a note, we show a little red alert on the job that you can click to view the details.
Diana Lamirand
 And so when the scheduling happens, and weather gets in the way and you have to reschedule something and let the customer know, is it automatically just sending them a text or an email and saying, ""We need to reschedule""?
David Vroblesky
 Basically yeah, you would just click select all to select all the customers on that day and then click send text message and type own message there. And then it would text all the customers whatever you type. And then it would log that on the job and show a little text icon that you could see that they got that text message.
Diana Lamirand
 So, saving a lot of time in a lot of areas?
David Vroblesky
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yep.
Diana Lamirand
 So, do you have any metrics as far as that goes, as far as the ROI or the time savings or money, revenue increases, or no?
David Vroblesky
 Unfortunately, I don't.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. That's fine.
David Vroblesky
 Most of it, it's qualitative.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 Like, talk to this person kind of deal.
Diana Lamirand
 Yeah. Yeah. For sure. So you created this and now I understand that you're leaving, right?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah.
Diana Lamirand
 So, how does that work? Is Crew Control your baby? Are you signing off Crew Control to Aspire, or how is that working?
David Vroblesky
 So I have already been acquired by Aspire.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 So beginning of 2021, we got acquired by Aspire.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay.
David Vroblesky
 They approached us. We weren't looking to sell at the time, but they approached us and wanted to invest in some of the smaller lawn and landscape companies out there that weren't quite ready for Aspire. And they really liked Crew Control. So we met with them and it seemed like a really good opportunity to work with them to try to grow it faster than we could grow it ourselves.
So we joined the Aspire team at the beginning of last year. And we've been growing it with them. Up until then, my co-founder, Daniel, was working another full-time job. So we were very bootstrapping it, growing it on the side. And we were doing a good job, but we wouldn't be able to grow it as fast as if we worked with the Aspire.
Diana Lamirand
 Yeah.
David Vroblesky
 That was a really good opportunity. And then I'm moving on to another startup company in the restaurant space. Not because I wanted to leave Crew Control, because I'm really passionate about it. It was really hard to leave, but because I have a friend who approached me with a really good opportunity to join his startup company in the restaurant space.
So I'm leaving Crew Control in good hands, though. It's got a team behind it now, because I've been working with Aspire over more than the last year to help build out the team and the product. And it's in a really good place to continue growing.
Diana Lamirand
 So, did they give you any information? I can talk to Ken, but I just wondered if they ... Why they approached you? They just wanted to add something to Aspire that was a little bit more affordable and more accessible to smaller companies?
David Vroblesky
 Exactly. There were a lot of companies out there, actually more smaller to mid-size companies than there are larger who can afford Aspire. So there's a lot of those companies out there not quite ready for Aspire, but they wanted to better serve the industry. And instead of building something and trying to simplify what they've already done, they thought it would be better to go out and find someone who's already serving that market that they could invest in.
Diana Lamirand
 That makes sense.
David Vroblesky
 That's where they found Crew Control. We met with their team, met the people, the executive. They're good people and we decided it would be a good opportunity to both work together and try to grow it.
Diana Lamirand
 As far as the tiered options, the $30 a month ... Or is it $30 per crew? Okay.
David Vroblesky
 Yeah.
Diana Lamirand
 And then $50 per crew for the upgrade. So the main difference there is just the electronic proposals, right?
David Vroblesky
 That's right. Yep. Yep, we may add more in the future too. We're always rolling out updates, but as of right now, it's the electronic proposals is the only difference.
Diana Lamirand
 Do you know any kind of metrics as far as how many of your companies are on the $30 a month version versus the $50 a month version right now?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah. It's probably 90% are on the $30 a month version, but we just rolled out the $50 a month version at the end of January this year. So it's only been out a little over a month.
Diana Lamirand
 And did you do that because customers are asking you for that? They wanted to be able to send proposals electronically?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah. Yep, they wanted to be able to send proposals electronically. It had come up, but then it was also identified by a consulting company that Aspire had worked with, as another capability to help us continue to grow Crew Control. We didn't want to recreate Aspire, but we wanted to grow Crew Control and compete against some of the other solutions out there. So they identified that as one of it, but it had come up from customers as well.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. And what about customers as far as anecdotally? Have they given any feedback? I'm sure they have, but does any feedback stand out in your mind as far as we really help these guys grow 50% faster or something like that?
David Vroblesky
 I think we have a blog post coming out right now on how we helped Latitude 41 get over a million dollars in revenue for the first time, and helped them grow their business. And I've talked to customers before who had no way of really knowing whether they were making or losing money, and being on the phone with them the first time they logged into Crew Control and were able to view that data, and were just wowed at how much money they were either making or losing on some of their customers.
And being like, ""Oh, wow, I need to go back and bid this customer higher."" Or, ""Wow, we're doing really well over here."" So just getting that additional insight has been great. We've helped customers go on vacations for the first time, because they've been so tied to the office and the paper processes that they haven't been able to get away. But I had customers like Billy who was able to go on a deep sea fishing trip out in Florida.
And he was able to use Crew Control from his phone, make sure the route was built out ahead of the time and his crews had everything they needed digitally. Didn't actually have to be at the office. The same thing with my Uncle Rick. He was in Aruba. He was able to get away and he could still see throughout the day, if he needed to, which jobs his crews were at and what they were doing.
Diana Lamirand
 Thank goodness for Uncle Rick, right?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah. Do you want to see a picture of him?
Diana Lamirand
 Sure.
David Vroblesky
 Actually, I don't know if I can share my screen.
Diana Lamirand
 I can maybe give you the option to share. I don't even know how to do that.
David Vroblesky
 That's okay.
Diana Lamirand
 It's all right. Okay. As far as the ... Let me think here. We talked about scheduling, we talked about why you set out to do it, and we talked about electronic proposals. So I think we've covered most of everything.
What else would you say I need to know, as far as the software itself? Do you see expanding into industries that you weren't thinking of when you first thought about creating this?
David Vroblesky
 Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. You never know who might end up using it. People are using it for all sorts of things nowadays, like mechanics scheduling jobs for equipment that they're fixing, and distributors using it to deliver supplies at construction job sites, dirt hauling, all sorts of stuff. So yeah, I think it'll continue to expand. I think it'll get smarter over time too, as far as the route optimization.
When you have new jobs coming in, we'll help you figure out where that job should go based on how close it is to other jobs, your capacity on different days. I think we'll always keep things simple. We always want you to be able to log in and the first day, start getting value from it. You're never going to have to go to an implementation. It's always going to be self-service. It's going to be easy for the crews and for the admins.
And I think it's just going to grow and grow, and grow, and just help more and more people. We have a really good product. It's just a lot of people don't know about this yet.
Diana Lamirand
 Yeah. Go back to that reporting thing. So I think that for me, as a layman, it seems like that would be super valuable, just to understand the net profit, the gross and net profit margins and understanding, like you said, how much money you're losing on jobs and that kind of thing.
So, are these folks, the people who are signing up, are they finding real value out of those reports? Does it help them understand their financial insight in their company?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah, it's super easy. It just helps them know how much revenue per hour they're making. And a lot of these companies will have a certain number that they know, ""Hey, every hour, I need to be making this much money in revenue because of my costs."" Especially for maintenance. There's not a lot of material cost most of the time. And without tracking the time and having a way to report on that, it's really hard to figure that out. So we definitely help with that.
I had a friend Jesse, he was working for a landscaping company and then he started his own. And after a couple years, he felt like he wasn't making that much money, but he wasn't tracking his time. He was just doing stuff, doing the work. But when he finally took the time to track it, he realized he was making way less money on his own than if he would work for someone else. Plus, he was scared about getting injured and stuff, but took him a while to get to that point to actually figure out whether he was making or losing money.
And then at that point, he had a choice to make of either going back to working a job or doubling down on his own company. And he ultimately went back to working for a company. But then since he started one, taking his learnings and he started his new company and growing it. So it's all part of the learning journey, but if you don't have that insight early on, you're flying blind a little bit. So we definitely help people in a way that it's just easy. You don't have to spend time getting set up or talk to a consultant, or do a million clicks.
It just meets you where you're at, but gives you the data that you need at a basic level to figure out whether you're making or losing money.
Diana Lamirand
 You don't need someone sitting there, holding your hand and walking you through it. It's just pretty much self-explanatory.
David Vroblesky
 Yeah.
Diana Lamirand
 As far as the reporting goes, does it help with understanding where you're maybe lacking on the data that's being inputted as far as ... I just read something today that there was a client who basically they schedule a job out and this job required 10 bags of cement, but they only used five. But they just went ahead and entered 10 in the system.
But the system automatically triggered. It's like, you didn't use 10. So you need to keep track of that and make sure that you're not overcharging the customer or whatever. And does it help do those kinds of things, or even the non-production hours that their teams are doing? How does it monitor that?
David Vroblesky
 Yeah. We help in light ways in all of those areas. So you can input how much you think a job should take and then the crew can put in how much is used. And then whenever you run your reports on your completed work, you can see the difference to help you with some of that. Or if the crew spends extra time and they log a note as to why, now you can see that whenever you go to invoice to charge extra for it. So we definitely help out with a lot of those different areas.
As far as productive versus non-productive time, since we have payroll time tracking and we also have job times, you can see how long an employee worked. And then of the time that they worked, when did they leave the shop in the morning? When did they get to the first job? And when did they get back to the shop? When did they clock out? We have a lot of that data that can help you as well.
Diana Lamirand
 And probably no more time listings on restaurant napkins and lot of that pieces of paper in their track, and all that kind of stuff. Okay.
David Vroblesky
 Yep. Exactly.
Diana Lamirand
 All right. All right. I think you've answered my questions. Is there anything else that you think is important I didn't ask you about?
David Vroblesky
 I don't think so. No, I really appreciate the time. Hopefully, that gave you a good overview. And yeah, check out the website and just reach out if you have any other questions.
Diana Lamirand
 Absolutely, I will. So you're there until the 31st, is that correct?
David Vroblesky
 Yep, that's right.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. I have your email address, so I will definitely ping you if I have questions.
David Vroblesky
 All right. Thanks, Diana.
Diana Lamirand
 Okay. Thank you.
David Vroblesky
 Appreciate it.
Diana Lamirand
 Have a good one.
David Vroblesky
 Take care.
Diana Lamirand
 Bye-bye.
David Vroblesky
 You too. Bye."

 All right, Chris. So, what is your title over there at Enviroscapes?
Chris Kline
 I am a Landscape Designer and Commercial Estimator.
Abby Hart
 Okay, great. Are you the primary person that Joshua speaks with about Land One or-
Chris Kline
 Yes. Sorry.
Abby Hart
 Okay, perfect. Fantastic. So this is going to be, because I didn't realize until after the fact that Enviroscapes is also an Aspire user, I'm going to ask you background about Enviroscapes, and then we'll talk about Land One and then we'll also talk about Aspire. But if you feel like you're not the person to talk about Aspire in great detail, then I can talk to somebody else at Enviroscapes, if you think that's a good idea. Do you think that you can speak intelligently about both or-
Chris Kline
 Yeah, for the most part, Mike May, I would say he's probably the... he's with our corporate team. He's probably the most well versed in Aspire, but I don't have a lot of experience here at Enviroscapes outside of Aspire.
So the transition point may be a little, you know what I mean?
Abby Hart
 Gotcha.
Chris Kline
 We were purchased by Aspire. I worked for American Beauty Landscaping and we were purchased by Enviroscapes in 2017 and Enviroscapes got Aspire in 2018. So there wasn't a whole lot... I don't know how well I can speak of the two.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. So, [crosstalk 00:01:41] you've been pretty well entrenched with Aspire but you have experience with other software, correct?
Chris Kline
 Oh yeah. Correct.
Abby Hart
 Okay, perfect. Yes. Well then that honestly might be enough, and it actually is an interesting perspective that you bring as a designer and an estimator, because I've primarily been speaking with owners and the decision maker behind bringing on Aspire.
So it'll be cool to talk about someone who uses it daily, because some of these guys don't. Okay, great. So Chris, how long have you've been with, I guess technically in, Enviroscapes, since 2017, you said? Or with your company?
Chris Kline
 2017. Yep.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. And how many people currently work at Enviroscapes?
Chris Kline
 250.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Chris Kline
 In that ballpark.
Abby Hart
 Okay. Can you talk a little bit about customer mix, surface mix and revenue? Is that something that you have that you can tell me, or-
Chris Kline
 Absolutely. Yeah. So we are a commercial landscaping company. We do some large-scale high end residential work, but it's mostly tied to commercial.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Chris Kline
 So we're 40% landscape, about 8.5 million. We're 40% maintenance and enhancements, at probably around nine million and then snow we're 20% at about four million.
Abby Hart
 Okay, perfect. I'm sorry. So doing the math, total rev is... you eight and a half nine and four?
Chris Kline
 Yeah, 21, 21 and a half.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. Let's see. Can you talk a little bit about your background and how you ended up at Enviroscapes and your day to day as an estimator?
Chris Kline
 Yeah, so like I mentioned before, I worked for probably the largest landscaping company in the Youngstown, Ohio market, which was American Beauty Landscaping. We were purchased by Enviroscapes in 2017.
And I was part of that merger, well purchase, not a merger. And so Enviroscapes we just integrated into their processes and their company. And as far as sales and estimating and design, I was actually a Field Supervisor. So I have about 15 to 16 years of in field experience with a hardscape field supervisor. So... high end residential, commercial work, installs, and I got the opportunity to move into sales.
So I grabbed the bull by the horns. So it was a real sink or swim type situation. And I was able to keep my head above water and I been doing this ever since. So it was really a great opportunity for me.
Abby Hart
 That's great. What drew you to the landscaping industry and your initial work in it, and then now to sales?
Chris Kline
 So I've always worked in landscaping. I really, other than some jobs here or there in college, when I was 16, I started cutting grass. And when I got my job at the first actual professional landscaping company, I ran a mow crew, and mowed grass for two or three years, got my pesticide applicator's license.
Did pesticide application fertilization and moved into a Maintenance Supervisor. And then I went into hardscape construction. So I'm pretty well versed in pretty much all aspects of landscaping, but really since I was 16, it's all I've really ever known.
I always wanted to do more. I was always very creative, very good at art, those types of skill sets. So it's really cool to look back now and it's like, ""Wow, all those talents that I have when I was younger, I'm actually using them now in my mid thirties too, as a career.""
And I never really thought I would... I thought I'd be laying brick the rest of my life, but it was just the right opportunity at the right time. And that's just the environment here. Enviroscapes, we like that we can do things here that you never really thought possible. We give those opportunities within first, and I think that's really a good thing.
Abby Hart
 That's great. So what do you like about what you're doing now, versus being a field supervisor?
Chris Kline
 The challenges day in and day out, just new, it's refreshing. I feel like I've built every type of patio I can build. I've laid driveways, I've [inaudible 00:07:06] and not that I don't still love that work, I still do, but it's just a new set of challenges on a day to day basis.
And it really was just refreshing to me to do something different and challenge myself as a person and professionally. So I think that's what I like most about it. I like the analytics of it, the dealing with customers. I think that was always my strongest suit was just dealing with the customer. And now it's on a much larger scale and it's not just a residential customer, it's just general contractors and architects and it's... Just being able to really, how do I want to phrase it, be being able to tap into that strong suit that I know I have and do that on a daily basis, pretty much.
Abby Hart
 That's great. So let me ask you this. Were you at Land One or using Land One before you, well, I guess you wouldn't have been using Land One as a Field Supervisor?
Chris Kline
 No.
Abby Hart
 Okay. So can you talk a little bit about the challenges you were facing prior to onboarding with Land One?
Chris Kline
 So I think the most specific example would probably just be lessening that degree of estimation error.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Chris Kline
 So allowing me to really provide the most accurate estimate that could be the quantity of plants on a job site, to just quickly measuring properties through a near map or a PDF, getting the volume or calculating the volume of material in an area more quickly. Those types of things, Land One has definitely helped.
I do use AutoCAD a little bit, but this is just a little bit more of a streamlined, basic tool. And I find myself using Land One 98% of the time. And Joshua was always really great at listening to the customer and, ""Hey, what do you want to see? Or how can we integrate this to make this more efficient?""
And he took our feedback and then a lot of times in those situations, you're like, ""Yeah, it'll happen.""
And he would implement... It would almost be within weeks. It's like, ""Hey, that thing we talked about, you can do that now."" Which was really cool because you felt like you were really getting feedback, and he was really listening to the clients.
So I think that's what really sold me on Land One, was just that relationship we have with him and just how far it's came. I mean, it really truly was a takeoff program at first and now I feel like it's a design program.
Abby Hart
 All right. So you mentioned streamlining the process, more exact estimates and measurements. Were you considering any other programs prior?
Chris Kline
 Yeah, there was a few others. To be specific, I probably couldn't remember because I did look at so many of them. We were shipping jobs out for takeoffs, a lot of times with there being, we have two Designer Estimators with Enviroscapes, and then we have a Business Developer and we have Account Managers in the maintenance side.
So there'd be times where we would get overwhelmed with projects and it was, ""Hey, let's ship this one off our takeoff. Let's just let somebody else do it, free our hands of it.""
And so I think that when Land One came across and it was just so simple to work with, you so quickly get what you need out of it. It just made more sense to do it in house because I was being able to get two things done in the time it took me to do one.
Abby Hart
 Can you get specific about an instance where Land One changed your business for the better, a particularly hard project design, or-
Chris Kline
 Yeah, I mean, there's been a few, it's hard to nail down to one. We've been on a project now where we've been doing a park restoration project for the past two and a half years.
And when it's all said and done, it's going to be a $5 million project and to be able to take that plan set. And we were a General Contractor on this project too. So it wasn't just landscaping. There was asphalt work construction, we're running a $900,000 pavilion structure build right now at this park.
So being able to use it and push its limits, and use it for things that most people don't, it helped. I mean, I was able to take that entire plan set document, and that's a lot of landscape plans and a lot of things like that. And it might sound funny, but the color coding of shrubs and color coding of perennials, things like that, it just made it easier on the guys in the field.
So you get that positive feedback it makes you, ""Wow."" This is worth it. It's worth the work. And they're starting to... Because if it trickles down to the production, if it makes my job easier, it makes their job easier, then it's a win for everybody. So that would probably be the one instance that comes to my mind is I was able to use on a job of that scale. And it was just a vital tool.
Abby Hart
 That's great. So, better communication and clearer plans [crosstalk 00:13:00] for your production crews. Great. Are there any specific metrics that you can point to as to how Land One has helped your design process or estimating process? I don't know if you guys track how fast these things go out, but are there any specific metrics like that?
Chris Kline
 Not really in that regard, as far as how fast we can turn around a bid, or turn around an estimate. From a design aspect, I think the integration of Near Map, that made a big impact because I'm no longer going to [inaudible 00:13:41] to pull an aerial photo or a measurement. I can do it all in one space.
Which is what's exciting to me about Aspire purchasing Land One is, I'm excited for what the future holds and that integration's really going to present itself a year or two, three years from now. So that was huge because as simple as that sounds, it's one less step and every time you got out another step, you're being more efficient, more productive.
So the Near Map was really great. I always teased Joshua a little bit because there was no copy paste feature. So I'd get these large distribution centers where there might be 50 island beds that are the exact same size. And it's like, ""Okay, this doesn't feel efficient.""
Now I can do that. And to set the little details go a long way. As far as like... I know it makes me more productive. I turn things around quicker, but as far as tracking that time, we really don't... we track our production probably a lot more closer.
Abby Hart
 Okay. So it's funny that you mentioned [Goilon 00:14:59] because you know that Aspire also acquired Goilon. How are you... now I'm just curious, because it's my job to know about all these solutions as we acquire them or as they partner with us, but how were you using go Goilon in conjunction with Land One, or, were you?
Chris Kline
 Oh yeah, a little bit. If it was a presidential project I could get on there to get my benchmark on a design, to going to design a patio or I'm going to design the layout of a sidewalk or a landscape.
I would go to Land One, get that benchmark measurement, or snip a photo, or download that photo and then transfer that to Land One, and then do my overlay where now it's very simple. It's right there.
I [inaudible 00:15:51], it pulls it up and I'm still getting that nice crisp image, depending on the year. There's leaves on the trees and all those fun things that come into play with that. But it's just, again, it just keeps cutting out that other step.
Abby Hart
 Okay, great. I'm still getting a sense for, or how... now that aspire has acquired Land One, the two solutions are not integrated yet. So can you... there is the plan for that, but I don't have a day, I just know that it's coming, but can you tell me how you use the two solutions in conjunction with each other? Just so I have a sense of the workflow, I guess.
Chris Kline
 Of?
Abby Hart
 I'm sorry, Land One and Aspire. So you design... Can you just walk me through?
Chris Kline
 Yeah. So, the good thing about Land One is... like AutoCAD, it doesn't necessarily give you layers, but in a sense, it does just a little bit more of a basic fashion.
I look at those plants, I go down through and create all the areas that I need to create. I do my take off and now there's that step from taking the information that I've gathered on Land One and transferring it over to my opportunity and Aspire. Now, what I hope to see is that integrate it does that for me, because that would begin cutting off that next step.
We're pretty well trained at that here. I think we do it our very best to try to find the quickest route to be more productive and be efficient. And that's definitely going to be that next step, which I'm confident they'll figure it out. That's what I'm doing right now. So that is that extra step, just transferring that information, but I'm no longer using that spreadsheet off to the side, so in a way I am still being a little bit more efficient.
Abby Hart
 Okay, great. I guess let's switch gears to Aspire for the moment and then we'll come back together and talk about both of them in conjunction. So can you tell me your experience using like business management software when you were at American Beauty and then... Were you using a software there?
Chris Kline
 I mean, we've always used some type of a software, but it was probably more paper based.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Chris Kline
 Especially tracking times, so my experience with it was, again, from more of a field perspective, so making sure that my guys were clocking in, clocking out, making sure they were tracking billable and unbillable, all of those things. So I think that was probably the biggest challenge is not being able to really easily track that and see job costs.
That's been the biggest change is, I mean, what can't Aspire do? I mean, thing is, we really can see the big picture on just about everything.
And it's always evolving. I mean, it's evolved since we first started using it and we used to have management meetings where we would just share what we've taught ourselves. We were still learning it. And this is back in 2018, 2019. And it was like, ""Hey, I found out that you could do this or you could do this.""
And so it was just a collaborative effort really. And I guess that's my answer.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Okay. So job costing when you were in the field, a lot of it had to do with clocking labor and that kind of thing. Can you talk about once you moved over to the estimating design side, how Aspire impacted your day to day, I guess, aside from the job costing... Does that make sense?
Chris Kline
 I guess if I'm following you... maybe not job costing, but everything as far as ordering material and tracking POS and things like that, just having the ability for the guys in the field to pull it up on their phone and know the estimate, see the estimate, know where they're supposed to order their material from. It got a lot of the guess work... I think in the past, you may have a good relationship with a vendor and you automatically go to that vendor, but maybe that's not the most cost efficient answer for this project.
And you don't know what the estimator was thinking and you don't have that information readily available to you. Now you're buying your purchase material, that's more than what's a bid for the project. So really just some clarity, from the office to the field on, it talks to each other, so both of them know what each other's thinking and track that. And just again, it all goes back to productivity, so-
Abby Hart
 That's great. Okay.
Chris Kline
 Is that what you were looking for?
Abby Hart
 Yeah, absolutely. So, really a lot of it is... Communication, clarity, efficiency, cost effectiveness. That's really what I'm hearing. Is there anything else as far as... I'm trying to think of other value ads that I typically hear from Aspire customers.
Sorry. The last person I talked to was a Controller and that is a whole different set of... Let's see here. Any other operational efficiencies that you can think of that Aspire provides?
Chris Kline
 I mean, it's a little bit of everything. I mean a contact book. To be able to... I'm constantly searching for contacts in there because I know if I haven't dealt with that person in the past, my counterpart in Louisville, [Rhonda 00:23:01], she probably has. So I really truly think I use it just about for everything that it can be used for, from somebody in my position.
Just looks on properties and being able to pull up addresses and contacts and all of that. It really is just a vital toll. I mean, it's more than just an estimating tool. It's more than just a sales tool or anything. It just helps the business all the way around, just smooth.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Okay. I guess that really covers how your roles have improved using Aspire. Can you talk about what challenges Enviroscapes is currently facing? Obviously it's always growing, you guys just got acquired by Shell. Is that accurate?
Chris Kline
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 So what business challenges are you guys facing currently and how can Aspire and One Land help to meet those challenges? How have they been helping to meet those challenges?
Chris Kline
 So if I think of challenges, I think the first that comes to my mind is probably just the supply chain issue that we're facing all over. With this state of the world that we live in, the daily impacts that we're seeing within this industry and maneuvering those challenges and finding sustainable solutions, I think the pandemic really affected business and for that matter, continues to affect business, I think we have to constantly retold ourselves. And I think aspire has been a huge part of that. I think the green industry as a whole has done a really good job at maneuvering through the pandemic. I think, maybe I'm biased, but I think a [inaudible 00:25:04] especially we've really done a fantastic job making sure that we're keeping our employees safe and healthy and putting the right processes in place.
And if we wanted to work fully remote with Aspire, we could. There's just so many things that this program, I think, helps when it comes to the way that the world seems to be trending. It connects us all, being able to not be cooped up in an office with coworkers, but being out on job sites, but still being able to access all that data is important.
And I think it was... I wonder sometimes how we would've really done it when it first happened, because at first everybody was terrified and nobody really knew what was going to happen. And it was like, ""Are we going to have jobs? Are we considered essential, are we not considered essential?""
And nobody knew, and I think that as things became clear, I think what became clear to me with Aspire was, wow, how would we have done this without Aspire? And I think that was... to be able to sit in my living room and hop on and create an opportunity, that made things very easy.
So I just think that as far as challenges looking forward, who knows, with the state of this world, but I think it's a good tool to have in your arsenal for sure, because, it's proven effective in the past, so-
Abby Hart
 Great. I wanted to touch on, and this is something that I don't think I've heard anybody talk about, but you mentioned that Land One and to a certain degree Aspire, although I'd like to hear what you have to say about it, but Land One and maybe Aspire have enabled you to use these creative talents. Can you talk a little bit about how knowing these tools and using them effectively might help? other people in the industry...
Chris Kline
 So a good example of that is I've been able to help our maintenance department on multiple occasions, and it could be something as basic as a takeoff on a park for snow and ice, but creating details, you see these landscape details, and then plan sets, and it's not just a takeoff program.
You can use all the tools that takeoff program offers you, and you can create an actual detail on how you want a project built. It doesn't have to be a 2D, aerial image, it can be a masonry wall. It could be a set of steps. It is really your creativity, I think, is the only thing that limits what Land One can do.
I've overlaid renderings that were hand drawn with it, and been able to create a pretty full piece to present to a client. There's just a lot of different things you can do with it.
It's not AutoCAD, but it's for what it is, it serves a lot of those same purposes. I think you just [inaudible 00:28:45] willing to push it.
I know Josh and I shared designs that I had done and some things like that. And I think he even made the comment once that, ""You're using it a little bit more than what it's intended for, but that's good.""
So, it's a cool program. For me, I just can get lost in just playing around in it and seeing what you can do.
Abby Hart
 That's awesome. That's great. So, Chris, can you talk a little bit about what your goals are for this year and how Aspire and Land One can help you achieve those goals?
Chris Kline
 Yeah. I think my goal's always the same. It's going to sound cliche, but it's just to continue to grow and improve as a professional. I think that as I evolve as a designer and an estimator, I'm confident that Aspire and Land One will evolve along with me. So I think, like I said, it's been an invaluable tool for me.
And, I believe with that integration with Aspire that it's just going to become more beneficial to that growth. So I think that as time moves on, I mean, like I said, I really am excited. I told Josh that multiple times when I found out that Aspire acquired Land One, it was like, ""Oh, cool.""
It wasn't like it was another software program that we don't use where it's, ""Which direction is this going to go?"" Those were the two biggest tools that I use every day, is Aspire and Land One and now-
Abby Hart
 Oh, wow.
Chris Kline
 So now that they're coming together, that's exciting for me because to make our jobs as easy as possible and still... I think my goal is, like I said, just to always improve and always grow and I think that's how they can help.
Abby Hart
 That's awesome. Great. Let me think if I have any other questions that I wanted to ask... Chris, now that I've got you.
Chris Kline
 No, you're good.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. I mean-
Chris Kline
 [inaudible 00:30:54] so if you don't...
Abby Hart
 Do you read any particular websites to get education or information about the industry, Chris? This is just a question for me as a content creator in this space.
Chris Kline
 Yeah, Landscape Management, I'm a huge LinkedIn guy, so I'm always on LinkedIn reading. I would say probably I listen to my peers in the industry more than I do articles against the magazines or anything like that.
I have a stack of them here, but, I want to know what companies in Florida are doing or what companies in New Jersey are doing or California. What's the general consensus to the industry all over the country, not what somebody who's just writing about it is telling me, I want it straight from the source. So that's why I think I lean towards just reading LinkedIn. One thing about this industry and maybe it's just because that's the majority of the people I follow on LinkedIn, but they're very open.
They're not really hiding anything. They're just transparent with their business and their financials and their... It's like a community. And I know our Market President now, Todd Pugh, I know he's very transparent with us. And he's constantly talking to companies like east coast facilities or Loving Landscape or companies like that. They're constantly visiting each other and learning from each other.
And I think that's really cool that you're competitive, but at the same time that sharing and growing from each other, I think that's a really cool thing. And I just think that's what's special about this industry.
Abby Hart
 That's awesome. Is there any content that we can provide on Land One or Aspire that would really useful to you as an estimator or a designer? How did-
Chris Kline
 Yeah, I think as far as content... I think, again, I talk about reading things from around the industry, but it's mostly business owners. The Owners and the Presidents of those companies, sometimes it's the Controllers, like you had mentioned before, the guy you last spoke to.
But I would like to hear more from more estimators, more designers, how are you doing things? Maybe out of the box thinking, because I'm an outside of the box thinker. I don't box myself into what's the standard, this is what I'm going to do. If I can figure out way to do something and be more efficient, I'm going to do it. So I'd like to hear more of that from other estimators, other designers, and I'm sure if you asked our Field Supervisors, they'd tell you the same thing.
They want to hear more from other job Foremans or whatever you want to call them, Field Supervisor Foreman, just a little bit more of a personal connection would be nice too, because I don't see a lot of... There's a few estimators that I follow on there, a few design companies that I follow that I do keep up with, but besides showing off pictures of their designs that they're not really too much sharing how they do things. So I think that would be really good content for somebody in my position to read.
Abby Hart
 Given that it seems like you are a power user of Land One in your company and sounds like overall, given what Joshua has said about how you use it-
Chris Kline
 I'm really the only one to be honest with you. I've been pushing it and I keep trying to sell it to our maintenance guys. Like, ""I think this would be good. You know what I mean? I think you guys could use this."" And [inaudible 00:34:51] they love to be able to go on there on their iPad and create a quick design. And it's like, ""Hey, you can do that on Land One.""
So, I actually met here with Tom Ferguson is his name, he's our account manager for our Youngstown branch. And he sat here and we spent about an hour on Tuesday. And I gave him a crash course and he just hopped on my account and played around with it for a minute and I pulled up what he did, and I'm like, ""Oh man, I'm not a bad teacher.""
That's pretty cool to see, so I do see a potential and I told Joshua that I definitely see a potential in more people in Enviroscape using the program, but it's my primary pull. So I'm using it every day. And so, I guess I am in a sense.
Abby Hart
 Are there any other applications that you see for it that you think would be helpful for other estimators or designers to know about?
Chris Kline
 I guess just what I mentioned before with it being more of a design tool than just a takeoff program because I feel like that might be the label that it gets is, it's a takeoff program.
You're going to be able to find the square footage of that piece of lawn or that mulch bed or... But again, I like to push it to its limits and I like to try to design with it as much as possible. And I had told Joshua a while back, ""We need textures. We need those types of things. I need to be able to distinguish what's a rock bed from a mulch bed."" And within 2, 3 weeks, it was like, ""Oh, I have textures now.""
So it was really cool, and those types of advancements and things like that, I think that's what's really made it up its game a little bit to become more design program. There's still things I'd like to see, there's things I would like to pick his brain about and things of that nature. But I have no problem searching for items that I need, whether it be furniture, boards, things like that.
I find the images, I purchase them off Adobe and then I transfer them over to Land One and I use them within my designs. So I mean more options like that would be great. There's always room to improve for everybody, as well as a program. So those are things I've shared with him in the past. But like I said, I think there's optimal opportunity, especially here for a lot of use.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. Great. Okay, Chris, I think that we've pretty well covered my questions if I have any. What I'm going to do is I'll probably work on this over the next week. I'm hoping by the end of the week, I'll have a draft for you. Would you be able to email me your headshot and any design or something that I can use the blog post? That would be awesome. I don't know what you have access or what you think we should have permission to use, but-
Chris Kline
 You can use whatever. I don't covet anything that much. So I want to share, you know what I mean? I want people to see this is what you can do with it, so I can get some stuff together... Trying to think if I have a headshot. The last time we took pictures...
Abby Hart
 I know, I need to get mine done too, so I get it. So whatever you can send my way, I will have a draft for you hopefully at the end of the week, next week.
Chris Kline
 Yeah, and I mean, if there's anything that pops up from now, till then that you want to add, just shoot me an email. I'll give you [crosstalk 00:38:46]
Abby Hart
 Thank you so much, Chris.
Chris Kline
 No, thank you. I have a terrible sinus infection, so hopefully I made sense. I'm a little foggy.
Abby Hart
 You could not tell at all, but I will be in touch if I have any follow ups.
Chris Kline
 Okay. Awesome. Thank you so much.
Abby Hart
 Thanks so much, Chris, take care. Bye bye.
Chris Kline
 Bye."

 All right. Okay. Basic stuff right off the bat. What is your revenue, and what is your customer mix and service mix? Kyle, if you want to just jump in with that.
Kyle Cahill
 Our revenue for 2021 will end up at about $5.2 million. And our customer mix is we are residential, high-end residential landscape architecture, construction, garden management firm. We have three main departments. We have our landscape architecture department, our landscape installation depart, and our garden management department, which Levi is our director of garden management. And so, within those, in the landscape installation, we have an irrigation arm. And then, in garden management, we have a plant healthcare and an irrigation/water management arm in there as well.
Abby Hart
 Fantastic. And that was all residential, Kyle, you said?
Kyle Cahill
 It's all residential. Yes.
Abby Hart
 Let's see here. Could you give me percentages on each of those divisions?
Kyle Cahill
 Goodness gracious. I would say, we right now put landscape design in with the installation because we're relatively young in that. Levi, what do you think on garden management? Do you think we're like 50/50?
Levi Johnson
 If it's not 50/50, then it's pretty dang close.
Kyle Cahill
 Okay. That's what I think too.
Levi Johnson
 It might be 40/60, meaning 40% construction, 60% landscape and maintenance just because of all the enhancements we had last year. But I think we're probably 50/50.
Kyle Cahill
 I would say he's right, with our ultimate goal of actively growing our garden management side of the business.
Abby Hart
 Okay. Let's chat about the background. We can chat about how the company started. And then, we can go in and describe a day currently in the life of your company.
Kyle Cahill
 Sure. Grow and Company started in December of 2016. And I had worked for a large landscape firm in Dallas for almost nine years prior to. And Levi actually worked for the same company as well. But recently, I had moved to Houston and was working for that company. And then, in December of 2016, had decided to start my own company, Grow and Company, and operated it for 18 months growing organically. Just myself with a truck, and then, myself and a guy, and then, grew organically from there. Officing out of my house, and had a dumpster in my driveway, and really just bootstrapped it. And my nurseryman where I bought plants, my neighbors in the neighborhood was great and very supportive. In fact, a lot of my early clients came from the neighborhood.
And as I grew over that 18-month period, and I had a diesel truck starting up at six o'clock in the morning, I had a dumpster sitting in the driveway, which was handling the trash from the end of the day. And guys showing up early in the morning, they're like, ""Hey, you know what, Kyle? We've been supportive. This is great, but you need to find a place to really operate a business out of, a landscape business."" And I thought, okay, fair enough. So, I spoke with my nurseryman, who I bought plants from, and I just asked them if he knew anybody who would lease me the back corner of their lot. Because it was just me and a couple of guys right now. I didn't really know what I could afford.
And he introduced me to a company called Glauser McNair and gave me the phone number to Danny McNair, one of the partners there, as a potential place where I could set up shop for a little bit. But he had mentioned that these guys were actually looking to retire and to sell their business. And I did not think that that was feasible for me. And so, I just took that number and put it in my pocket and said, ""All right, thanks."" And then, a couple weeks later, my neighbors let me know for sure that it was time to move out. I was like, ""All right. I'll get out of here. I'll get out of your hair."" So, I ended up cold calling Danny McNair and just introducing myself, how I got his information, and if I could talk to him about leasing a portion of their land.
And they had operated a residential design, build firm and maintenance firm in Houston since 1991 is actually when they, he and his partner, Robert [Lauser 00:05:37], partnered. And they had both been in the landscape industry since the early '70s in Houston. So, they were real OGs of the industry here in Houston and just really remarkable men. And I was very lucky to have been introduced to them and to get to know them. That happened in December of 20, when was that? 16, 17. It was December of 2018. So, I guess that was about 18 months after or so I was connected with them. And then, they told me that, hey, we're really wanting to sell the business.
And we decided to, they would let me move in with them first and feel each other out to see if we were a good fit. And then, in June of 2019 is when I officially bought their business, bought them out. And it was actually an asset purchase agreement. Grow and Company just actually overnight grew. I purchased all the assets and the client list. And so, both of those guys stayed on board working with me throughout the transition. They really were good, refreshing. It was a good time. And I learned a lot from them in that year from all of their years and decades of experience.
Within that time, I realized, hey, I can't do this on my own. And we've grown significantly, and these guys are going to want to retire. So, that's where Levi came in. Levi, I've known, he's a great person, a great leader. I know he would do a great job. He actually was my intern at the previous company. And we had a great relationship. And so, I called Levi, and he believed in me, and he believed in what we were doing. So, he came down, moved down from Dallas, and with the goal to run our garden management department. And so, he moved down in December of that year of 2019, and then, has been kicking butt ever since. Am I right on that timeline, Levi?
Levi Johnson
 That sounds right to me.
Kyle Cahill
 Okay. And so, Levi came onboard and has been really, really key part in us as we transition into, and this is where I'm getting to Aspire. Knowing that we had QuickBooks and we had paper time sheets. And growing a company and scaling a company, I knew from previous experience, that's not going to do it. And so, that's when I started researching and researching what software are we going to use? What are we going to do to set ourselves up foundationally now, that can scale with us as we grow, and grow as fast as we want to grow? And having the support of Levi coming in and helping be a key part in implementing that and getting us through the implementation. It's a lot of work. And so, that's where we decided... I did a bunch of research. I talked to a bunch of people. Aspire was the right fit. And Levi, myself, we really buckled up and went through implementation and haven't looked back, to be honest with you.
Abby Hart
 You went immediately from this analog process to Aspire, Kyle?
Kyle Cahill
 Yes. Yep.
Abby Hart
 When did you sign the contract with Aspire, and when did you go live with Aspire?
Kyle Cahill
 I believe I wrote this down. I think our implementation started in January. Let's see. Our implementation...
Levi Johnson
 If I remember correctly, you signed in December or January. And then, our implementation started end of January. And we went live in May.
Kyle Cahill
 And that was in 2019.
Levi Johnson
 Correct.
Kyle Cahill
 Yeah. End of January, 2019. Went live in May of 2019.
Levi Johnson
 May 1st.
Kyle Cahill
 May 1st. I think [inaudible 00:10:27] of 2019. I meant 2018.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. Okay. I was about to say, whoa, Levi, you started in December, 2019. You had no idea what was coming then. Because you were three months away from the pandemic. 2018 is when you started. Right, Levi?
Levi Johnson
 Yes.
Abby Hart
 Okay, perfect.
Levi Johnson
 Yeah. I started 2018. Right as soon as I started, I basically started with the implementation of Aspire.
Abby Hart
 And you were using paper time sheets. You had QuickBooks. Any other solutions you were working with?
Kyle Cahill
 No, that was really it. I had inherited, I shouldn't say inherited, but purchased the business, part of the increased asset purchase agreement, and it was all run off paper time sheets and QuickBooks. And that was it.
Abby Hart
 Just out of curiosity, how big was Glauser McNair when you purchased them? What was their rev?
Kyle Cahill
 They were about two and a half million, half to three. The last few years, these guys were looking to retire, so there was no growth.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. Okay, great. All right. Yeah. Let's pop back to what a day in the life is right now.
Kyle Cahill
 Yeah. [crosstalk 00:11:57] ask. It certainly varies with all the roles that we have. So, it's pretty dynamic as we continue to grow and evolve. I can say that our frontline and most of our management staff is here at the office by 6:30. And we are rolling out for the day. We're getting our schedule, what we're working on, heading out for the day. We've got garden managers that have a book of our maintenance clients. We have a product manager. We have a irrigation manager, that all have different roles throughout the company. And the day in the life is going to look much different. 6:30 in the morning, we get rolling, we get going. Crews are out working on jobs. Ideally, we aim to have crews back in between 3:30 and 4:30, just depending on their routes and if it's installation versus maintenance. Let's see. What other kind of specifics would you be looking for in terms of the day in the life? Because my day's very different than Levi's. And Levi's is very different than our project [crosstalk 00:13:19].
Abby Hart
 We can almost weave this question into... Let me change direction here. Let's talk about challenges. Prior to onboarding with Aspire, what were the top three challenges you were facing in your business at the time? And then, we can talk about how Aspire has made the day-to-day better. Yeah. Top three challenges you were facing in your business at the time. You had your recent acquisition. Let's talk about what were some pain points that you were dealing with?
Kyle Cahill
 Pain points would have been timeliness and invoicing was big because we were reliant on... We keep all the invoices together and all the time sheets together. And then, you invoice a job. And the company had very little overhead and management. It was literally Danny and Robert, the previous owners, and then, they would run their crews. They would design project manage, garden manage, they did everything. And so, it was a very cumbersome process of timeliness and getting invoices out. Cashflow was, to me, as recently purchasing the business, I was like, holy cow, we need to get this cash flow going, because we are uniquely a time in materials business. So, we work on our maintenance side of the business, if you think about it, we are working for 30 days, and we are tracking all of our time and materials for a particular client. We have 100 maintenance clients. At the end of those 30 days, we then calculate all the time, all the materials, and send an invoice.
Our clients are typically, it's due upon receipt, but typically, we don't start sending notices until 30 days. Best case scenario, I've got a 60-day turnaround time from when I start paying somebody on the first of the month to the end of the month I bill it. And then, the clients have until the end of that month. That can be 60 days. I was looking to like, hey, let's get these invoices out quickly for me too. So, that was a pain point. Scheduling was very, very difficult. In fact, it was really just, hey, these are the crews and these are the homes that we typically go to during this week. There was no visual of the schedule. It was all in someone's head. And we have pretty self-sufficient and driven foreman. They could come in, and they knew what they were doing. But it was like, all right, if we're going to continue to grow and scale, then we need to make sure everyone's on the same page. Where are we going this week? Where are we going next week? How are we planning for this?
And so, I would say then the third was really, for me, it was consolidation and organization of everything. Nothing spoke to each other. Scheduling to, I guess I could say, from putting together a proposal to scheduling the work, to invoicing that work, to putting all your job costs towards it. None of that was happening in one place. It was all just disjointed. And again, I recognized that this is not conducive for scaling the work, and putting people in places to be successful, to where then we can track it, and we can know if we're making money, where we're making money, if we're not making money, why aren't we making money? So, I would say those are my three major like, oh, crap, we need to get something that could do this for us and do it well.
Abby Hart
 Great. Timeliness and invoicing. Cash flow is related to that. I think there was a little blip in either my internet connection or yours, Kyle. You mentioned that you just wanted to make sure that clients were invoiced quickly in order to get paid quickly. I'm assuming that that's was the part that I may have missed because of the internet blip?
Kyle Cahill
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 Scheduling was a second, and then, consolidation and organization is the third.
Kyle Cahill
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 Great. Awesome. How did you land on Aspire then? What about Aspire appealed to you, if those were your main challenges? And then, we can talk about the day-to-day and how Aspire has made that better.
Kyle Cahill
 Yeah. I just started researching, and I just started looking in trade magazines and asking around, what were people using? What were their experiences? And Aspire was relatively, it wasn't brand new, but it was relatively newish back, what, three years ago or so, when we were starting with them. And all I had heard was good feedback about how intuitive and robust the system was. And one of the things that appealed to me right off the bat was, hey, you pay this price for something, and everything's included in it. I had been privy to one other operations software that was like, oh, if you want to have this unit, it's an extra this. And if you want to do this, it's an extra this. For me, knowing that whatever Aspire was going to be developing and releasing, hey, it was just coming through, you were going to be able to use it.
That was cool. I saw a huge value in that and that I wasn't going to get nickeled and dimed to death, and not know, oh, well, I should have got that equipment manager too. How much is that going to cost me now? Type deal. So, that was big. And then, one of the things that I really appreciated that Aspire did was they gave me the referrals. And so, I was able to call a few guys who had recently switched over to Aspire, who were using Aspire. And it was candid feedback. It's not like they were coached on what to say. It was like, hey, what were your challenges with Aspire? Tell me those. And they shared their challenges. Because implementation is not easy. It's a lot of work. But it's good work. It helped us with our business. It needed to happen.
And so, that really appealed to me because I felt like the process that Aspire did to ensure my success was good. And I felt like then, and I feel like to this day, Aspire's had a very, very good team, great people. Always willing to help out, always willing to answer questions, and really feel like I've got somebody who's wanting us to be successful. And so, I've really, really appreciated that. And it's never been hard to get ahold of anybody, which is great. And as a matter of fact, even through that process of referrals, I was introduced to Chase [Mullin 00:21:32], who is now, he's a mentor of mine through the Trailblazer program through now, which was that was my first introduction to Chase. So, it was pretty cool as well.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Chase is great. Levi, do you have anything to add about what drove the decision to pick Aspire? Or anything to add about implementation, or your current experience with customer success, or anything like that? I know he's in the car. It's difficult to...
Kyle Cahill
 I can tell you that was one of my, when I was talking with Levi about my direction for the company, before he moved down here, it was very much, I'm investing in this operation software because I'm going to build this thing right from the foundation up. I had selected Aspire prior to Levi coming onboard. But he was massive part of the implementation. And in fact, he was very, very involved with every aspect of the implementation. So, I know he could certainly speak to that. And if you're available to, Levi, I'd love for you to speak to that.
Levi Johnson
 You might have to repeat the question because I did lose you guys for the last five minutes.
Abby Hart
 No worries. Levi, we were just asking if you have anything to add, as far as how the relationship with Aspire has been, how the implementation works, how Aspire has helped Grow and Company grow. Kyle's or anything else that you just...
Kyle Cahill
 That sound [crosstalk 00:23:26].
Abby Hart
 [crosstalk 00:23:31].
Kyle Cahill
 [crosstalk 00:23:31].
Abby Hart
 No worries. And I'm happy to chat with Levi whenever he has a minute.
Kyle Cahill
 [crosstalk 00:23:40].
Abby Hart
 I think that we're all right here. But okay. Let's talk about what your top three features are in the software. I know we're getting software centric, but yeah. What are the things that you value most in Aspire?
Kyle Cahill
 Oh my goodness. Things that I value most. For us, the ability for real-time job costing is huge. And we are a bit of a, I wouldn't say black sheep, but we're different in terms of we're time and material. So, everything we've done so far has been like, okay, how does Aspire... I know there's a time and material aspect to Aspire, but we are the minority when it comes into all of our business is that way. So, how can Aspire work for us in tracking that and invoicing it? Because if you're contract-based, boy, it's quick, quick, quick.
I think that, the real-time job costing, and keeping track of building in our overhead, and all that stuff. Job costing is big. I would say, the payment, the invoicing, and being able to have our payment portal online. We went from 100% checks to a lot more folks have been paying online. And that convenience factor has been huge, as a lot of our clients like to do that. And so, the fact that we were able to provide that has been a big deal. And then, let's see.
Levi Johnson
 I'm back, by the way.
Kyle Cahill
 He's back.
Levi Johnson
 I made it through the forest.
Kyle Cahill
 Levi, we're talking about top three benefits from Aspire that we've noticed.
Levi Johnson
 I heard your responses.
Kyle Cahill
 Yeah. I'd definitely like to get what do you think? I've given two, but you might have some better ones. What do you think?
Levi Johnson
 I completely agree with invoicing, not just from the timetable of getting it quicker, but Danny and Robert would literally have everything written down. And then, they would take all that and write it on another sheet. And then, the bookkeeper would take that and make it into an invoice that we would actually send out. And then, you had to make something in QuickBooks to go along with it. So, it was such a tedious process, whereas now, the crew members are able to do it from crew mobile. The garden managers are able to allocate from inventory from a work ticket. It saves so much time in that aspect. And so, there's that aspect. So, that's one.
The second thing is from a production standpoint, yes, we're time material, but we still monitor production because we're not an open checkbook policy type company. That's just not how we are. And because that's just not who we are. But what I like about it, from at least me, is that I can manage expectations with our managers and with clients saying, ""Our budget for this property could be six hours."" And then, I could look back in the year 2019, the year 2020, year 2021, and pull up those numbers and say, ""All right, we hit 5.83 in 2019. And then, we were at 6.5 in 2020, and seven in 2021."" Why have we increased by a whole hour in the last two years? And so, we can start asking that question because I think there's a power in data and in getting those results.
So, that, for me, in a production standpoint, that's very helpful because it can easily just slip away into it, and you want to make sure you're... As I say, I'm the protector of the client's dollar. I want to make sure that that's the budget we gave them that we're going to honor that. And if we need to go over, then we need to communicate it. That's another one I would say, for me, as production standpoint.
And then, the third thing is a contact. It's a CRM, essentially. We have all the contact in there. I remember when we first were implementing Aspire, it was really hard to get all that information from Danny and Robert. And they had to go through their phone, and it was so tedious and difficult. And they were almost a little bit... Not Danny, but more Robert, was difficult in getting that because these were their clients, and they just didn't want to give out their contact like that. Even though Kyle had bought it, they made it difficult for me to get that.
Whereas now, when I hand off a property to a garden manager, usually, I can forward that contact information. But if I lose all my information, my phone, I know there's a backup. And so, it's not a humiliating process of going knocking on the door and saying, ""I lost your number. Can you give it to me again?"" So, I think there's a protection there, in a way, of being able to just have that information. That would be another thing that I would say.
Kyle Cahill
 And I would add, closing the month, we never did this. So, we didn't know, closing the month, seeing how profitability was for each department, seeing where our financials stood. We were simply, we got more money coming in than we do going out. Check. So, really, that's a big plus for us because we can review our financials monthly, and we do after it's closed out.
Abby Hart
 That's great. I know that month end tends to be such a hassle for so many businesses. So, that's great to hear. These are awesome. Thank you. Are there any specific metrics that either of you can point to as far as how Aspire has helped improve your business? So, I think we talked in my initial email, I think Peggy had let me know that you guys had grown 1.7 from is [crosstalk 00:31:02] 2020 to 2021?
Kyle Cahill
 Yes. That would be a [inaudible 00:31:09]. Or that's a specific metric right there. I would say our invoicing timeline is specific because we now, on our garden management side, have all invoices out by the 10th, Levi?
Levi Johnson
 The seventh.
Kyle Cahill
 Seventh. Okay. And it used to be like the 15th. So, we've reduced it by half, which is considerable. I would say those are two really specific ones. I guess closing the month, we've never done that. So, that's specific. We close the month. And then, I would say employee retention and almost attracting employees too because they see that we are committed to growing a foundationally strong company using a very robust software like this, that they haven't experienced in other companies that they worked for. I've had someone recently tell me that colleagues in the industry here working for similar companies have told them that, wow, you guys are much more organized than we are. And we're talking about competitors that I would've never guessed that. So, I think that's big and in part to our organization because we use a software such as Aspire.
Abby Hart
 That's great. That actually tied into one of my questions. Would you say Aspire helps you hire and retain good people? How so? You're committed to growing a foundationally strong company with good technology. Would you say that Aspire helps you grow while saving on headcount? I'm not sure if that's something... What's that?
Kyle Cahill
 No. I would say Aspire. I thought it would, initially. I would say that was a misconception. Because it's like, oh, it cost you X amount per year, but you're going to probably save hiring an employee. I actually hired an employee to specifically make sure Aspire was working properly for us. And that employee started off as part-time, but as we've grown, they've gone to full-time to help be our Aspire guru in the office. So, at least for my experience, and Levi, you can chime in on this, I don't think that it keeps us from having to hire somebody. I don't see that as a benefit. I see the benefits elsewhere with Aspire. Because Aspire is so robust and so powerful that you want to use as much of it as you can to get the value out of it. And that just takes really, I see it as investing into it. That's why we have this person on staff who I've invested in, in and above the software, in and of itself, so that... I don't have time to dig into the details. Levi doesn't have time to do that.
Levi Johnson
 Well, I was going to say, Kyle, I feel like a majority of my time as well is spent on usually fixing Aspire things as well. Like even more so now. Because I've been in the garden manager position basically since we started Aspire. And only in December was I finally able to [inaudible 00:34:43]. In November, I was finally able to step out of it. But since then, there's just been so much pileup. And I'm having to do a lot of training, which is another point I want to talk about, which is training. But there's so much of that, that I spend probably 50 to 65% of my day working out Aspire problems. And it's partly because I, other than Kyle, I'm the oldest user of Aspire, but a lot of my full-time job at the very beginning was setting up Aspire. So, I really got to understand the backbones of it. I believe I'm the system administrator too.
But because I know so much of the backend, a lot of the big problems come to me instead of that other Aspire guy, just because I know it. I won't even say just one person, it's almost two people that are doing Aspire. And it takes a lot of time. But talking about training, that's one thing that, because it's so robust, it's not easy to bring someone into Aspire. In fact, I think that's why we've lost... I know of at least one manager, you might be able to say the second one, but that's probably a stretch because there were some other things going on in their life. But one, for sure, she just talked about how overwhelming the job was, and everything she had to learn with Aspire, that she just didn't want to do it anymore. And so, she was looking to get out of the industry. That was [Christine 00:36:37], Kyle.
And it's because no one could really sit down and thoroughly go through it with her. And Aspire, it's once you know it, it's user friendly. But if you don't know how to use Aspire, you can mess up a lot of things. And it's even harder to fix stuff. And that's why I spend a lot of time with what I do now because a lot of... And it's just like today, someone made a wrong type of work ticket. And as a result and they did it in a closed month, so now, we have to bill it, and then, take it as a hit for the month, and then, reopen it. And it becomes like, sometimes, I wish I could go back to the paper thing. It's just like, oh, we'll just erase it. Let's just erase it. But you can't do that.
So, it becomes a half-hour project just to of $500 or whatever it might be. Or maybe it's just like, oh, the taxes weren't on it. And so, again, it's a half-hour project just to get taxes on it. And it's one of the things you're just like, ""Man, I wish I could just make it go away."" But you can't, especially with taxes. You have to really make sure taxes are correct. And that's part of the learning process. But for people like the guy that we have full-time doing Aspire and myself, it's very tedious and hair pulling sometimes because it is almost an unforgivable system. But at the same time, you don't want it to be easily changed.
Kyle Cahill
 That's one of the things I loved about Aspire was there's no hiding. You can't hide anything in Aspire. If you lose money or you're doing something wrong, hello, hello, it's going to tell you. And it can be cumbersome, but it protects us. So, we understand that value too.
Levi Johnson
 It's a balance, for sure, because just like Kyle said, it does protect us, but it's a double edged sword. It protects us and kills us at the same time.
Abby Hart
 I completely understand that. And that is actually great feedback. And especially, yeah. It is a robust system. There are all these ways that Aspire expects you to handle these processes. So, I get that.
Kyle Cahill
 And I would say, Abby, keep in mind though, we are a smaller, but quickly growing company. So, we've had folks who come to work for us who've worked at Yellowstone. And we're like, ""Oh, good. They know Aspire."" They don't know Aspire because Yellowstone is so big and robust, their roles like click two buttons in Aspire, and that's all they have to do. Whereas you come here, you are going to really use Aspire because in a smaller company, you're doing a lot more, typically.
Levi Johnson
 That's a great point.
Abby Hart
 For sure. No, I definitely understand that. To that end, are there any other ways that Aspire has really helped you weed out, and retain top performers, and improve efficiency? Can you talk to that a little bit?
Kyle Cahill
 Sure. I think naturally, it does weed out those who aren't going to be top performers because typically, top performers see the value in the organization and structure that we are trying to provide. The example Levi had given earlier about the person who it wasn't for, ultimately, they weren't the top performer anyway. And so, that was probably more of a mutual understanding and beneficial departure. I think in that respect, yes, it does help us weed out those who... This is our culture, this is who we are, this is how we are going to do business. So, it does help quickly weed out those individuals, who it's like, ""Hey, this isn't me."" And hopefully, we're getting that on the front end. But I think it has been a good differentiator among the people, our people.
Abby Hart
 Related to that, does giving people tools they need to do their job well help with retention, in your opinion? Why or how? That is kind of related to what we just talked about.
Kyle Cahill
 Yeah, absolutely. And I think that ties to... I think part of this is us continuing to develop our systems and processes, and then, develop the training around that for each individual role. What are the garden managers expected to be able to do within Aspire? And then, training them to do that. What are the project managers expected to do within Aspire? And then, training them to do that properly. All the different roles. And that's really where we are, is starting to define that. And then, starting to be able to build those trainings and those tools. Even for our foreman, as we roll out crew mobile, and training them to be successful with crew mobile, and so, that they don't just get frustrated by it and stop doing it type deal.
Levi Johnson
 Another thing I thought about that, sorry, I'm ADHD. I was still thinking about your question from three times ago. Another benefit brings is being able to work anywhere. There's times where I've had a client email me and be like, ""I need this today."" And if my paperwork was at the office, then that sucks. But because I have it in Aspire, most I'm able to re-forward that estimate. But now, it's another thing that we forgot to say was even our estimating process. Because as beforehand, Danny would go to a job site, and just like...
Kyle Cahill
 How did we forget that? Estimating. Huge. Huge.
Levi Johnson
 Yeah. And that's a huge part. But Danny would go and just like, ""Yep. This looks like about a $200,000 job."" And it was. He was that good that he just knew. I still call it my gut check. I go to a property for maintenance, and I'm like, ""Yep. This is about a three hours for a three-guy job."" And then, I take the measurements, I put it in, and it poofs, comes out with a nine-hour job. And I'm like, ""Yep, I called it."" But it's nice to have that double check for your gut. You can't just go off your gut. And so, that's also nice, is the estimating aspect of it.
Kyle Cahill
 Yeah. That's huge.
Levi Johnson
 And the fact that you make kits, and that you can edit it, and change it as things evolve over time. We've definitely had to rethink how we do things because with being time material, Aspire's really built well for contract. And we've had to make the hole bigger for our square peg or whatever. Maybe I said the wrong way, but you know what I'm saying? We've had to really adapt how Aspire works for us because it's not really well built for a time material, but it's built enough that we've been able to get by.
Kyle Cahill
 I would say too, I've got some more benefits for you. And you kind of tied in with it being cloud based. We were able to pivot quite nicely during the pandemic, early in the pandemic, and say, ""Okay, guys, we can all communicate through Aspire through the CRM, the estimating. Everything is you can get to it. So, here's what we're going to do. Stay at home at this time. We can still get work done. We can still get estimates out. We can still get invoicing done. We can still run payroll."" And we were able to pivot quite quickly. Had we been on our old way of doing things or systems that aren't that way, there's no way that could have happened. So, we all have laptops. We were all able to pivot. And so, that was huge because it was like, ""All right, that was not a worry."" That's massive. And then, there was one other one I was going to say, but it'll come to me. I'll let you know.
Abby Hart
 That's great. I just want to time check because we've actually gone 20 minutes over. Are you guys still okay to chat for a little while longer?
Kyle Cahill
 I'm fine.
Levi Johnson
 I'm fine.
Abby Hart
 Perfect. Okay. Let's see. We talked, I think we pretty much covered the hiring question or the HR-related questions. Yeah. If either one of you can think of any other things related to how Aspire has helped with retention or recruitment. Yeah. Actually, I don't know if we talked... Well, we talked a little bit about recruitment because people have been able to see, oh, okay, you run this system really well. Is there anything else that you wanted to say there about how Grow and Co has recruited people and how Aspire has helped with that? I don't know.
Kyle Cahill
 I don't really know if it's a big recruit other than, hey, we do run on a software. Because I'll tell you, not everyone's coming from the bigger companies where they've had software, and not everybody's been in the industry. So, recruiting, not so much yet. I can see where it could be a benefit, but not really for us right now. And then, I certainly think retention wise, yeah, we couldn't be operating at the growth that we're doing and the size of company that we are the way we had done things previously. People would've quit like crazy.
Levi Johnson
 I think the only maybe recruiting, I just feel like the millennials and the younger generation, they're just a lot more... And I'm saying this, and I'm considered a millennial, but they're just a lot more technology motivated. And so, I feel like that might be an aspect, but it's not something we go out and like, ""We use Aspire."" Usually, a question they'll ask is, ""Oh, do you use a software?"" I'm like, ""Yeah, we use Aspire, and it's been a great system."" So, yeah, I would agree with Kyle. It's just not something that we maybe... But we're not really heavily recruiting yet either, at the same time.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. How many people do you guys have on staff right now?
Kyle Cahill
 48.
Abby Hart
 48. You mentioned that some of these folks don't come from the industry. Has it been easier or more difficult to show them the ropes with something operating a system like Aspire? I'm just curious.
Levi Johnson
 I would say easier outside the industry than inside.
Abby Hart
 Really? Okay.
Levi Johnson
 Because inside the industry, you have a bunch of knuckleheads.
Kyle Cahill
 No. Yeah. Because they come in without any preconceived notions of how it should run. And so, it's kind of their first introduction to it. They're like, ""All right, cool. Let's do it."" [inaudible 00:49:37].
Abby Hart
 Interesting. Cool.
Levi Johnson
 The example I would use is when we brought on the controller, she picked it up, I felt like, in a week. But then, you bring in a garden manager, and they're so used to being hands-on in the field, using a shovel, using chemicals that when you stop, and you can use a computer, they're just like, ""Oh my gosh."" And so, it can be overwhelming for them because that's not their favorite tool to go to. They'd rather be out with clippers, not on the computer.
Abby Hart
 For sure.
Levi Johnson
 Well, especially with what we do because we're high-end residential. We're about being in those gardens as garden managers. But they're learning.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. I just have a few more questions. And this is just a random one, but how would you feel if you couldn't use Aspire anymore?
Levi Johnson
 Back to dragging my knuckles on the ground. It'd be like saying if the car was taken away tomorrow, and I had to ride my bike to work. I'd get it done. It'd just be a lot more difficult. We'd be going back to a lot more time consuming. Instead of leaving at 5:30 in the morning, I'd probably need to leave at 5:00 or 4:45 in the morning. So, you got to plan for more time because there's definitely efficiencies that have come along with it as a result.
Kyle Cahill
 And I think then, there's a fear of the unknown of your data. Like Levi touched on, and I think that's super important, is over the past three years now, we've collected some very good data in how to plan to operate the business, and make finance financial decisions for budgets for the next year based on historical data, and how we see we're tracking on certain things. Losing that would be scary, from a planning aspect. And then, operationally, I would just be super concerned of... I love the visibility and the transparency that Aspire creates. And not having that would be an uneasy feeling.
Abby Hart
 Right. That was good to know. Okay. What business challenges is Grow and Company currently facing?
Kyle Cahill
 I would say, right now, our business challenges are really growing pains. And they are developing our processes and our systems around the team that we have and the positions that we have to be conducive to our current growth and our future forecasted growth that allows us to continue to be efficient, productive, profitable, and really, at the end of the day, love what we do because we're landscapers too. We got into this industry because we prefer the shovel over the computer. And we like to be out there with the clients and being a part of the gardens. We are landscapers that do business. We are not business people that do landscaping. I can tell you that. And so, there's Levi's face.
I would say that is our biggest challenge because we're constantly evolving. And so, where we think we haven't had an issue before, then we're like, ""Okay, now we have this role. And it's highlighting some issues that we have to correct. Let's get this fixed."" I think that's, for me, it's a growing pain challenge, and then, making sure that we are on top of it and creating those systems and processes. That, to me, is the biggest overarching challenge because I think everything can tie into that.
Abby Hart
 Great. Any additions, Levi? Oh, you're on mute, Levi. Sorry.
Levi Johnson
 I think the only other one I might just say is anything new is a big undertaking in task. So, we started off with just construction and maintenance, but then, when we added irrigation, that was a huge task. And it's still playing in now. It's not an easy snap, like you can just change a bunch of things. It's very tedious. I'm taking this from an Aspire, not just in general. If you want me to talk in general, I can talk about in general, but I wanted to go specifically into Aspire. But any changes you're wanting to make is a big task, and it's not easy to make a big change.
Kyle Cahill
 Specifically, we've had an irrigation company that we had purchased, brought onboard as well. And now, creating with that, we've got to create our items, our way to estimate that, our way to invoice.
Levi Johnson
 Our services.
Kyle Cahill
 How are we going to do it for service versus construction? Building that department or that branch in Aspire, that's a challenge. And we're going to do that again with PHC Plant Healthcare, which are we do a lot of those. So, it makes sense for us to do it internally. But it goes back to Levi's point about, gosh, it sure would just be easier to do it really quick and dirty on a piece of paper and send it out that way. But-
Levi Johnson
 In the long run.
Kyle Cahill
 Yeah, we look at the long run, we get it set up here now, in three years from now, we're saying, ""Okay, good. Now, we've got three PHC technicians, and we can all do it the same way,"" type deal.
Levi Johnson
 Yeah. And the best thing I think Aspire has done is they sign a person to every single company because I think they recognize that Aspire continue to evolve, and to grow, and there's questions, and the current clientele need help. They need guidance. And just because they are onboard doesn't mean they're done growing. And that not all the systems are running perfectly and having... We had one, and he wasn't very responsive, but when we were reassigned to Peggy, I feel like we've really been able to hone in, and actually, we're humming along better. We've still got a long ways to go, but we're humming along a lot better than we used to. And I think [Phil 00:57:37], and partly because we have weekly meetings with Peggy, whether we have anything specifically we need to talk to her about or not, she's there. She's a huge support. So, having that, is it CSM? I think that's what the...
Abby Hart
 Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Levi Johnson
 Having that CSM has been, I think, also critical to our Aspire growth. I think that was the smartest move that Aspire has made in our behalf.
Abby Hart
 That's great. That's good to know. I'm sure Peggy will love to hear that.
Levi Johnson
 Oh, dang, this is recorded. Oh no. Now she knows that I think she's great. I take it all back.
Abby Hart
 I will edit this down to just that quote.
Levi Johnson
 I'm just kidding. You can put that a replay for her. She needs it. She's wonderful.
Abby Hart
 Fantastic. I guess this is my last question, unless... I'm sure we could go on and chat further about these things. And if either of you have any additional comments after we wrap up here, please send them my way. And this is related to the question I just asked, but what are your goals for the new year? And what are your business goals for the new year, and how are you looking to Aspire to help achieve those things?
Kyle Cahill
 That's a good question. As a leadership team, we have our company-wide goals that we all discuss as a leadership team. And then, this is the time of year where every January, we have our annual reviews for all of our employees. And on the management side, we establish three goals to be accomplished within the year for each manager. Typically, these goals are all connected with these overarching goals that we want to establish as a company, so that at everyone's got their part in helping us achieve these goals. The first one, it's a big one, and it's one of our mantras, is improving our communication internally and with our clients.
I can say that this has already started on an Aspire aspect with how are we using the CRM for clients that are calling in the front desk? They get our number, okay, we're picking up the phone. How are we handling calling this person back? Getting that data, that information into the system as a task or as an issue, getting it sent to the right person, so that it's trackable. Because before, we used to just answer the phone, and be a note on a piece of paper, and put on the desk of the individual who we assume it's for. But now, we can track that. We can say, ""Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Smith called in on Monday. And a task was sent to Kyle, and it's Wednesday, nobody's been called back. What's going on?"" So, it's trackable now. And that's communication with our clients. But overall, as you grow, I'm sure you know, communication, it's the number one thing to success, and it's free. All we got to do is communicate.
The second is improving our foundation. When I say foundation, what I mean by that is how do we operate as a company? Foundationally, we have to be strong. I've been asked, well, how big do you want to grow the company? And I really don't have a number. It's, we'll grow as long as we're doing it the right way. And that we have a strong foundation, and Aspire is a key part to that foundation. And I've been in other situations where when you try to grow, grow, grow straight up, but that foundation isn't solid, boy, it is scary at times. So, we want to improve the foundation, which means we got to continue to strengthen our processes and procedures. And a lot of those reside within Aspire with the different roles. How does a garden manager use Aspire? How's the project manager using Aspire? How is Levi using Aspire? How am I using Aspire?
So, we have to continue to develop those processes. From estimating to implementation, to invoicing, what does that roadmap look like? And how does that roadmap work in Aspire? And then, we've got to just continue to train and develop our team in Aspire. And we do that through going to the Aspire conference. Happy to hear that it's in San Antonio this year, so we won't have to travel so far. But we really enjoy that. I think that's a great benefit of being part of the Aspire community too, is having that. And so, we continue to develop and use those resources.
And then, our third goal is a moderate top line revenue growth. And obviously, we're able to achieve that through what were the efficiencies we're gaining in Aspire. But we want to have these top line growth, not at the cost of a significant reduction in our net profit. And we are able to track that through Aspire and make sure that, hey, we're not giving up points in our net profit just to have a sexy top line type deal. We're going to be really focused on the profitability, the net profitability. And having that transparency through Aspire gives us that.
And then, we want to, of course, with that growth, we want to always be sure that we're staying true to our mission, vision, and core values. It's not necessarily Aspire driven, but part of it is the type of company that we want to be, and Aspire, certainly being a tool that we invest in to make us continue to be that company. That's what I would say are our three main goals without getting into all of the sub goals of those three main goals.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Awesome. That is some serious work you guys are doing over there at Grow and Company. Oh, I had one more question. You both came from a Dallas company? I'm just curious. What was that company? I won't put that in here now. I'm just curious.
Kyle Cahill
 Are we still recording?
Levi Johnson
 Are we still recording? [crosstalk 01:04:46] Both from Southern-
Kyle Cahill
 Type it in the comments.
Abby Hart
 Oh, Southern Botanical? Okay, great. Well, but really, my final question, which is related to that-
Levi Johnson
 And by the way, that's not a bad thing.
Abby Hart
 No.
Levi Johnson
 It's a great company we learned a lot from.
Kyle Cahill
 Yeah. We learned a lot from them.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Good. Yeah. I won't put that in here if you guys don't want me to. So, coming from Southern Botanical, talking to all other companies, what do you think sets Grow and Company apart from other landscape companies? And this will be my final question for real.
Kyle Cahill
 I can send you our mission, vision, and core values because that's really what sets us apart, and we can talk through those. It's probably easier if I do because they're sitting right there.
Abby Hart
 Very good.
Kyle Cahill
 I'll send those to you so you can actually see them.
Abby Hart
 Sounds good.
Kyle Cahill
 But I would say, I feel like that's a tough question because it's so all-encompassing, but I feel like we really strive to be not only provide... Trying to think of what everybody says. Provide the best service. Like I said, we are landscapers and horticulturalists doing business. And we really pride ourselves on knowing our trade and being the experts in what we do. And like when Levi goes on a property to talk about maintenance, he's going to tell you how things are properly done. Not just, ""Hey, here's our maintenance program. We're going to plug you into it."" Boom. That's not how we do business. We're a very custom-based business.
Levi Johnson
 We are not for everyone.
Kyle Cahill
 And we are not for everyone, and that's okay. And we're okay knowing that. And again, what sets us apart is our transparency and really our time and materials because what we do, you're going to pay for what you get. And if that means because of the rain, we could only service your property twice this month. Well, you're only getting billed for two visits. And then, if you had a party and you wanted us to come an extra visit, well, you're going to get charged an extra visit. And we just feel like this open, honest conversation and relationship with our clients has been refreshing for both us and the client. And again, we're still in the minority that we'll see. It's been successful for us. And so, I think that's a huge differentiator. What do you think, Levi?
Levi Johnson
 Yeah, something I don't know, it's like my sales pitch, I guess you can say, is we've been on the contract side of things. And in my personal opinion, someone gets screwed, either the client or the contractor. You don't do business to lose money. You don't also do business to rob other people. You just do business, so you can provide a living for your family. That's the goal of business. And I feel like it's a refreshing, and sometimes, I feel it's a little more honest approach to landscaping having it time material because you're charging what you do. But that takes a huge dig at the entire industry because everyone's contract based. But it's been refreshing to do it this way because there's nothing hidden. We're very, very straightforward. And that's one thing Aspire has brought is that it can help us bring that transparency, especially with our billing. It was being done before. They were literally typing it out before, but we are able to put that on our bill and show our transparency down to the 0.01 minute. But not everyone likes that, and that's okay.
Kyle Cahill
 Yeah. And it's not us digging at the industry at all.
Levi Johnson
 Not at all.
Kyle Cahill
 It's us finding a way of doing business that I was introduced to. I've done time and materials work in the past, but I haven't seen a whole business model made off of that and really meeting the-
Levi Johnson
 In fact, I've done time material, and I hated it. And when Kyle told me we're doing time material, I was just like, ""You got to be kidding me,"" because all I've ever done is contract. I was just like, ""This is so much harder than it's going to..."" In my mind, I'm complaining, but now, I'm just like, ""Man, this is a lot."" It definitely takes more time because you got to count everything. But it's refreshing.
Abby Hart
 With time of material, just to be really clear about this, so time and material, this is different from contract in that you are literally just billing and estimating very specifically? Can you clarify how that's different from contract?
Kyle Cahill
 The best way to describe it, say you called in here like, ""Hey, Grow and Co, I'd love for you to maintain my landscape. What's it going to cost me?"" So, Levi's going to go out there. He's going to meet you. He's going to talk about your expectations. Do you have a current provider? If so, what do they do? So, we can make sure we are providing those services on the level of frequency that you're expecting. And then, we'll take all that information. We'll take all the measurements of your property. And we'll use this in our estimating in Aspire, and we can put out a budget. And we can say, ""Okay, Abby, based off of our metrics here, we anticipate it's going to cost you... Or it's going to take this much time for us at X amount per man hour plus the materials.""
Typically, with maintenance, we're really just selling you labor. There's not a ton of materials going in on the maintenance side of thing, other than your mulches, and seasonal color, and things like that, and potentially, fertilization. But what we say is, ""Hey, this is our budget, and we're going to operate off this budget. And we are going to schedule your job every week with a three-man crew to be there for an hour because we're going to try to stick to your budget."" And so, we say, ""We're going to operate off budgets, and we're going to invoice off actuals."" Then, Abby, if you come outside, and you're like, ""Golly, that rainstorm knock down a ton of leaves off this tree, do you all mind staying a little extra and make sure we get all that up?"" Absolutely. It's going to be 30 minutes more for the crew. 30 minutes times three guys, typically, in a contract world, you're not going to be able to recoup that 30 minutes. But that 30 minutes over 100 clients can really add up.
And so, yeah, the guys know, stay there and get it done. And the client is aware, based on the contract and the conversations up front that, we're basing this budget off of this much time at your property. Any times you're asking us to stay beyond that, it's going to cost money. And on the flip side, it kicked our butts last February when we had a freeze and weren't able to work for two solid weeks. Our revenue was... Now, after that, it went because of all the work that we had to do. But February was a grim-looking month financially. So, it's risky. There is some risk, but there's risk with anything, to be honest with you.
Levi Johnson
 And to add on to that, Kyle, it's also because of our vision of wanting to be sustainable that we have a sustainability in mind, that we're not just... The example I use is when we're on a property, and a garden manager goes through, and instead of saying, ""Oh, it's the time of year for us to mulch,"" well, just that bed might have that much mulch. It doesn't need mulch. It might need to be raked up some, but not just dumping on more mulch because the contract says so. But you might go, it might be at a different time of the year, and what that bed, all the mulch is washed out. So, instead of just like, well, I guess they'll have to wait until the next mulch season. Instead, we just go ahead and take care of it because we're just billing the material.
And so, we're able to do it when it's right and not necessarily when the contract deems it. With the freeze that we just had, I say freeze, we were down in 30 degrees for like eight hours. But as a result, the summer color that we did have, that has been doing great, it finally died. So, now, we're talking to the clients and saying, ""All right, let's look at a different color because it's been doing great up until this last weekend, because we've been above freezing. We have not gone below freezing yet. And it finally killed all the summer color."" So, now, we're actually taking out summer color, and we're putting in something that is more of a cooler plant.
And because we have them in mind instead of being like, ""Oh, yep. It's September or October. It's time to change out your color. And you've got these three options. What do you want to do?"" Instead, it's like, ""All right, obviously, these didn't make it. Let's do something else. This is what's available right now. And this is what looks good right now."" It's not holding someone hostage to, ""Yep, contract says you got to have it. Therefore, we're going to put it down."" And again, that's about horticulture. We're not producing a lot of waste and not generating waste, but we're generating what is needed. And that's the beauty of time material is because you do what's needed, not necessarily because it's what you have to do.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Okay. That is very helpful. It all sounds like it is, yeah, more sustainable, but it's also, it can be more difficult to invoice. And it's flexible at different... Depending on the weather, or the needs of the client, or whatever. That all makes sense to me. Thank you for clarifying that. Awesome. Guys, you've spent so much time with me. Thank you for your time.
Kyle Cahill
 I appreciate your flexibility. Last week was a heck of a week.
Abby Hart
 Everyone's okay now, Kyle?
Kyle Cahill
 Yes. Everyone is feeling much better and on-
Abby Hart
 Good.
Kyle Cahill
 Yes. But thank you very, very much for doing that.
Abby Hart
 Of course, of course. Thank you both for your time. I'm going to drop this this week. I'll send it back your way just to vet accuracy, and quotes, and things like that. If you have head shots and action shots of folks out in the field you could send my way, that would be fantastic.
Kyle Cahill
 I'll have [crosstalk 01:16:56] shot of Levi on Wednesday. [Marion's 01:16:59] going to come in. Because I've got an action shot of Levi, but he says it shows some gray hair, so we're going to have to change it.
Levi Johnson
 It does. I look like an old man. And I'm not old, okay?
Kyle Cahill
 Abby, [crosstalk 01:17:13] sent you, if you could confirm receipt of our mission, vision, core values, did that come through?
Abby Hart
 I saw an email come through from you, Kyle. Yep. Got it right here. Thanks so much. This is incredibly helpful. Oh, great. Yep. Got it all. If you could send any images my way, that would be fantastic. I will draft this, and yeah. We'll get this rolling, and thank you both for your time.
Kyle Cahill
 Awesome. All right, Abby. Thank you very-
Abby Hart
 All right. Take care. Be safe.
Kyle Cahill
 All right.
Abby Hart
 Have a great night. Bye-bye.
Kyle Cahill
 Bye.
Levi Johnson
 Bye."

 Right.
Kim Oswalt
 Great. And can you start by saying and spelling your name for me?
Scott Lesak
 My name is Scott, S-C-O-T-T, Lesak, L-E-S-A-K.
Kim Oswalt
 Cool. So tell me a bit about Castle Rocks and your role with the company.
Scott Lesak
 Castle Rocks is a high end residential design build and commercial maintenance and snow and ice management company. I am the CEO and co-founder of the company. We have been in business since 2004, really growing in leaps and bounds. Went through a period of time of kind of stagnant, figuring things out, and we consider ourselves kind of a startup from 2018 on. We began to transform the business from being landscape contractors who are out there doing work, to a true landscape business. And in that transition, we have experienced some pretty dramatic growth, 467% growth from 2018 to 2021. And we're not slowing down. We're still growing in leaps and bounds and keeping up with that. So-
Kim Oswalt
 That's crazy. So what changed in 2018?
Scott Lesak
 A lot. We got to a point that we recognized we needed to focus on business. The landscape, me specifically, I knew I didn't want to be laying papers for the rest of my life. I knew I didn't want to be running a mower the rest of my life, and if that was what it was going to entail to be in this business, I had to look for some other options. So my options at that point were either rolling over and giving up, or figuring out how to run the business, and have some help with that.
Scott Lesak
 So that transition was... I would say, 2014 to '18 was the timeframe that I really started learning about business. I also pinpointed a lot of key things in my own personal life that I had to change. There were quite a few habits I had to change. One of the most notable ones, I quit drinking in 2018. Haven't had a drop of alcohol since then. And that was revolutionary for me. Just noticed a negative trend, negative pattern, and decided to change that before I lost more than I ever realized I could have lost.
Scott Lesak
 So that really jump started a personal growth journey for me. I made some changes and saw how good I felt about those changes, and saw the changes in my life. So I decided to passionately pursue that, and that was really... I was always about positivity and personal growth, but the reality was, I was getting in my own way for that. I was living a different life than the story that I was telling, and that was a timeframe that it became time for me to actually live the life that I was telling and live the life that I wanted to. So that year 2018, we did 267,000 in revenue. Completely transformed the way that I lived.
Scott Lesak
 2019, I continued to carry that. We did over a half a million dollars. Don't remember the exact number in 2019, but it was pretty much doubling in size year over year. And 2019, really started getting stagnant again, and started... Personally, started getting stagnant again, and recognized the patterns from the past and thought, ""I need to do some more with personal development at this point to continue moving forward."" And at that point, what I call my personal growth journey really began, and really started intentionally focusing on reading books, intentionally focusing on changing myself and my outlook, my thought process, my mindset, on everything.
Scott Lesak
 And that carried through for about a year. And I noticed some drastic changes in myself. From there, we decided to start putting some of that stuff into the company. The managers and I sat down, and we really decided that it was time to push a positive people-first culture. In today's world, everybody talks about people first, and we treat our people first, and there's a lot of lip service done without action.
Scott Lesak
 We wanted to make sure we were the company that was actually taking action, so we started focusing on our people, doing more detailed one-on-ones with every employee, finding out where they were, what they were liking, and not just asking about work related stuff, asking about personal questions, asking about personal life, family, and helping them better their lives. And that was really... That was one of the biggest turning points. We invested in our people in a way that was never done before.
Scott Lesak
 So from there, we started sending out morning text messages, motivational text messages every day, through the group chat that everybody gets the message, and it's just some type of words of encouragement, and not just a froufrou like, ""Oh, success doesn't create happiness. Happiness creates success."" We dig into your neuro pathways and your brain work this way, and you can build new neuro pathways by changing your habits for this amount of time, and what are you practicing today?
Scott Lesak
 And really diving in on a much deeper level. Fast forward to today, and that's exactly what we're doing. We're carrying that to the next degree. We are doing weekly leadership meetings that anybody in the company is invited to when we're in the off season and snow season. As long as we don't have technical level work, the technical guys are allowed to come in, and it's just really transforming our business through a people-first culture and a truly people first culture.
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah. That's exciting. It sounds like you've experienced a lot of change in kind of a short amount of time.
Scott Lesak
 Yeah, definitely.
Kim Oswalt
 Prior to this shift, what was the size of your team? And what was your role in that?
Scott Lesak
 So I've always called myself the president and CEO. I don't give quite enough credit to the level of understanding the business that we had before that, because we didn't really take action. We had an understanding without an action in place. So I considered myself a president and CEO. The reality was in 2018, even 2019, that timeframe, I was project manager. Had a little bit of help managing projects. Definitely accounts manager, salesperson. I was wearing multiple hats. Estimator, bidder, designer. That was a bunch of different stuff that I was doing, and the company, the organization was at a size that we couldn't support hiring anybody else to do it.
Scott Lesak
 So that was the necessary step at that point. Before that, from 2011 to 2018, we were very consistently between 250 and 350,000 in revenue. We were very stagnant. We weren't growing. We weren't shrinking. Some years were better than other years, and a lot of that was a direct reflection of what was happening in my personal life. But there was no real movement. I mean, we were within a hundred thousand for that entire whatever, seven, eight year period.
Scott Lesak
 And during that period, going back to 2011, I was out in the field. I was a laborer. I was a crew leader. I was a project manager. I was a salesperson. I was doing it all. I was truly the owner operator, running everything and running ragged at that point. And that was... 2014 is the first milestone to talk about. Got into the book E-Myth by Michael Gerber, and really started learning about what a system and a process is within the organization, how they can aid us, how they can help us, and that was... I've always been very educationally focused. I have a degree from Penn State in landscape contracting and design.
Scott Lesak
 So education has been something that I tremendously value in my professional life. And that was a very eye opening experience, getting through that book the first time, and opened my eyes to how much stuff I didn't know. The more you learn, the more you learn that you don't know. And that was a big area. So that sparked my interest in learning how to run the business, how to get more of an actual business going than just being a landscaper. And I wore a ton of hats during that period, and the 2018 timeframe, we had done quite a bit of scaling to that point.
Scott Lesak
 We had a hierarchy organizational chart in place. We knew the directions we wanted to go. Just weren't taking enough intentional action to get there. And then 2018, 2019, we really honed in on that scaling. Ultimately before we grew. We'd scaled first, and then we grew second. We knew exactly the people that we needed to put in the exact roles and what those role functions were going to be. We just had to grow into that, and I attribute most, if not all of our success in, as fast as we did for that approach scaling first and growing second.
Scott Lesak
 A lot of people grow first and get caught with absolutely no idea how to manage what they have built. And we all hear about it. We got small again. We downsized. It was so stressful with all these people. Nobody could do it as good as I could do it. Those are very common things that you hear from owners, and the reality is that, that couldn't be further from the truth from my experience. Everybody I put into a position that I was filling before, is doing 10 times better than I ever did in that position, because they're 100% invested in that position.
Scott Lesak
 They're not focusing on all the hats and all the different rules and everything. So with that process, with that growth, is when Aspire came into the picture for us as well. We recognized that we needed a... It started out as a CRM. We were starting to lose track of some of our sales processes, and just not having them quite as organized as possible, and we also recognized that we needed a better workflow. Aspire kind of filled both those gaps. We interviewed a couple of the companies and ultimately landed on Aspire, but I think I'm jumping the gun there a little bit, and I'll let you get to some of the questions with that. So-
Kim Oswalt
 Oh no, that's fine. So when did you get on board with Aspire?
Scott Lesak
 So we went live March of last year, March of 2021. So we've been on for almost a year. We did our onboarding and our implementation November through... We were supposed to be done the end January, or end of February, but we had an extremely snowy month last year in February, so we wound up missing a lot of our implementation, and it pushed through to March for us. But yeah, we've been live since March 1st of 2021.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay. And were you using any kind of software systems before that?
Scott Lesak
 So we were using a conglomeration. The system that we were using was QuickBooks. So I mean, I'm going to use that generically. We were running our estimates through that. We were running our invoicing. We were tracking our clients. We had our client data within that. Receiving payments. It was working pretty well for us, and the half million to million dollar in revenue line, that was perfect for us. That was a good setup. When we started pushing that million dollar mark though, we recognized the volume of estimates that were going out and coming in.
Scott Lesak
 And we had a dynamite bidding system. Our VP of operations is... He's literally saved in my phone as Kevin Spreadsheet Heilman, because he is just an Excel wizard, and built an incredible bid system, not too dissimilar from what's in Aspire. So we were very confident with the bids we were producing. We were very confident with that. The issue arose that we had that bid. We had great, phenomenal pricing, and we had to copy and paste all that pricing into a contract template.
Scott Lesak
 Then we had to write up the work descriptions from that, which were already pretty well detailed in the bid system, but it didn't transfer over, and it wasn't quite detailed enough to copy a paste. So there was redundancy, number one. We were double entering data at that point. And then, we sell that contract. We get the signatures on it, and we have no workers. We have no schedule. So we had to triple enter that information into work orders, and into scheduling, and anybody who's in this business knows exactly what that means. We only did double entry, and we had very terrible work orders because that was the straw that broke the camel's back.
Scott Lesak
 And we just wound up not doing that part. It worked for us for a little bit. We had enough people with great experience, with eyes on everything, but we determined that that was not a scalable approach, and there was just so much time being wasted with that double entry that, the CRM sparked the thought, but we really pinpointed that that was even more of an issue. Then, that kind of went into analyzing our job costing.
Scott Lesak
 We always had been doing very detailed production analysis, very detailed job costing, seeing exactly where we're doing everything. Pen and paper before Aspire. And the reality of that is, I still have a stack of those papers sitting on a shelf right behind me where I'm sitting right now, from two, three years ago that the data was never entered. It's solid gold, and it's very accurate data, but it was never quantified anywhere into a usable platform. So combining all of those pieces is really where we started seeing the value in Aspire, and pinpointing that we needed a software solution that was going to give us a lot more than what we were currently experiencing, to continue the growth that we're having.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). And now that you've been on it for almost a year, what are some of the pieces that you've found most valuable?
Scott Lesak
 Most valuable hands down, is job costing. Job costing and reporting, down to the hundredth of an hour. I mean, it is incredibly detailed, and from my position not doing any of the operational work anymore, that's essentially my job. I'm [inaudible 00:12:43] finances all the time. I'm working on amending processes. With Aspire, it changed all of our processes and the way we did everything, because there's new language there, new ways to get the work tickets, new service levels, items and all that stuff that if anybody is reading or listening to this that doesn't know Aspire, is a foreign language.
Scott Lesak
 But it transforms the way you do business with that language then. So that was really the big one. A lot of people right now are talking about how drastically they have to increase their prices for this year. Our fingers have been on the pulse since May of last year. We were watching this in detail, and we were incrementally raising our prices the entire time. And now, the only ones that are having 15 to 20 percent price increases right now, are our renewals that were in contract at that point. Anything that was a fresh bid, we were incrementally increasing that pricing, and we knew exactly where that pricing had to be, and we've followed the market literally on a daily basis, keeping our finger on that pulse with the job costing information.
Scott Lesak
 So out of everything, that's the number one best, most valuable resource that we're getting out of the program.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). And how is... Like you said, you've paid attention to scaling as opposed to just letting growth kind of continue unchecked. How does Aspire enable you to do that?
Scott Lesak
 It's the system. It's the root. It's the foundation. I mean, everything that we have done revolves around Aspire now. Everything we had done in the past has to revolve around Aspire. Our process for landscape maintenance I'll use. I just got done rewriting that a couple days ago ,and that process, nothing changed for the field level, and the way the process is going to happen, the work's going to get done, but the way the outline looks for that process to transfer it to everybody, each heading is a service level item.
Scott Lesak
 And we have our spring cleanup, our mulch, our routine service visits. Everything is detailed the way it comes up through the work orders at the service level, and that is now the process. And it's a lot easier to train that way, because before it was like, ""Yeah, do a spring clean up. When you're mowing, do this. When you're doing your weed treatments, do this. When you're looking for stuff... Do that stuff every week,"" but now it's boom, routine service visit. Here's all the bullet points that are under that routine service visit. Here's how we can train you to do that. So really, it streamlined the training process as well.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). So how do you handle that training process for your employees now?
Scott Lesak
 Face to face. Live. We're doing training PowerPoint style. A lot of... In the last year, a lot of it was in the field. Coming live in March, that's a rough time of the year in the landscape industry. March to June, we call it 100 days of hell in here, and it's just a lot of work. So the reality of when we came in, everybody was just kind of flying by the seat of their pants, and we did a lot of field training. We did a lot of field learning. We had to just be playing and adapting.
Scott Lesak
 Now that we've had time to get fully embraced in the system, fully understand the system, and redo some things, we have training programs in place. And that looks like having everybody come into the office. We have a training room. We all have a seat. We all look and look at everything that we are doing, with PowerPoints around it, the process around it, the right verbiage around it, and then we go out and practice it. And that's how the training works. So it's a lot of implementation from the office side, and then practice on the field side.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). And how are you using work tickets now?
Scott Lesak
 So work tickets, we're using them for everything, everything that we do. Excuse me. But the work tickets go over, get scheduled. We have an operations manager that is responsible for scheduling, monitoring the work tickets, and we are watching everything, and that has changed. And we're in the process of changing that. We've noticed areas. Hardscaping, for instance I'll use. There have been too vague of service levels.
Scott Lesak
 We didn't want to too deep, that guys had to be clocking in and clocking out of certain tasks, but the reality that we found out was, we have no idea how long it takes us to install base. We know how long it takes us to excavate that base and how long it takes us to build the base and install the pavers, but we didn't separate installing the pavers and having the base. So we're changing and morphing those as we're seeing certain areas that we can really drill in and get a lot more accurate pricing from.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). And how has adoption been for your staff, using these new processes in Aspire?
Scott Lesak
 As with anything it's a learning curve. Aspire is a behemoth of a system. So anybody that would be looking to shift into a system like this, I always, when I get that question and for today will say, have an open mind going into it. It is not going to be perfect, and it is not going to be easy, but that's exactly what you're getting. It works itself out. As you learn, as you adapt, the power is unbelievable. And you know, that's the reality of it. Don't expect to jump in there and everything's going to be 100% and really good, because that's a false expectation.
Scott Lesak
 That is not what your experience is going to be. But that's because the system is so amazing and so powerful, that you have to really hone in and figure out exactly what's going to work best for your organization.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Scott Lesak
 And then, as far as our field people, it's been pretty effortless. There's been... Crew Mobile was a struggle for a couple weeks, because that was a different setup than... We've always been using mobile devices for time tracking, so that was not foreign, but Crew Mobile was just a new setup, and everybody's resistant to change. So we had to have those conversations and, ""Hey, this is not bad. It's just different. Make sure you guys keep that in mind.""
Scott Lesak
 And that was kind of the way that we addressed that all the time, and keeping to our people-first positive mindset culture, that was exactly how we handled it. This is different, not bad. So just make sure that you're embracing that. Learn it. If it takes you five hours today, it takes you four hours tomorrow, it takes you three hours the next day, that's exactly how this process is going to be. And that's exactly what we learned. Every time, it's like holy crap, that took forever to do. Is that how this is always going to be? In a month where like, ""Oh yeah, that's like 10 minutes now. That did not take five hours anymore. Okay. We're good.""
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah. Yeah. There's always that learning curve. I feel like you have a unique perspective because you're on the management and business ownership side of it now, but you also have done the work in the field. Right? Because that's kind of how you got started.
Scott Lesak
 Yeah. Absolutely.
Kim Oswalt
 So when you're thinking about people who are in those roles now, what does Aspire and using Aspire look like for them?
Scott Lesak
 I mean, we have the crew leaders monitoring all the job costing stuff. So that's kind of where the entry level of getting into Aspire is, crew leader and above. Everybody knows what it is. We use the terminology on a daily basis. Everybody's watching it. From my perspective, being a field guy and then coming into where my position is now, it's incredible learning that the guys that are in the field are getting right now, because they're starting to learn all this vocabulary. They're starting to learn all this stuff that I just told you about, that took me months and months of time to develop.
Scott Lesak
 And they're learning that right off the bat. New employees understand Aspire language within the first week, because that's how we talk. And it's very powerful and very career building for those guys. There's going to be the certain field guys that never want to move up, never want to go anywhere else, and there's going to be other guys like, ""What's the difference between a service and an item? I want to know about that. Can you show me the other side of this?"" Or, ""I want to see what that is,"" and we get those questions too. And it opens up great conversation to really start introducing people to a different level of the business than they ever thought.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, that's great. And how has your experience also informed the way that you're running the business now, having been in these other roles?
Scott Lesak
 Oh, it's paramount. I always focus on... I have always enjoyed. My passion at the beginning was doing high quality work and taking something that was nothing, and turning it into something that was beautiful. What I do on a daily basis has not changed. The tangible commodity that I'm producing has changed because I'm working on developing a business on. I'm working on developing a company culture that's beautiful by the end of the day, that didn't exist yesterday.
Scott Lesak
 But it's still the same type of job. So in that respect, the tasks have changed drastically. I'm not building patios. I'm not planting trees. I'm not out sitting on a mower. I'm not digging holes with a skid steer, but I'm still working, creating and developing things. And that's the beauty of it. And I really have been able to hone in my personal mindset to realize, this is exactly what I've always wanted to do. The technical side of what I do has completely changed, but it's still doing that. It's creating something from nothing.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. And you've mentioned your culture a couple of times, but... Yeah, in addition to the text message, are there other things that you've implemented to forward that culture and your core values?
Scott Lesak
 Yeah, so every single morning we have a 10 minute rollout meeting, 7:00 sharp, to 7:10 sharp. It's a time thing as well as a motivational thing. But we talk about positive mindset. We talk about personal development, and we relate it to the daily tasks that are happening on the production side of things at that point. So if we're going to have a tough day that people are running wheelbarrows up a hill constantly all day, we'll bring that up to that crew and say, ""Hey, today's going to be a physically strenuous day, just so you know, just so you're ready. When you need a break, take a break, and make sure you mentally pause as well, because this can get taxing on you. We understand that. Make sure you're handling this the right way.""
Scott Lesak
 So that's another... That tandems with those text messages, having those rollout meetings every single day. And we have rolled that into all of our processes, all of our training. It all is that positive mindset, personal growth centric, and we talk about emotions. We talk about stuff that people don't usually talk about in this business. We're rough, tough construction workers, and in the eyes of many... And the reality is, we're all humans. We have emotions. We have mental positives and negatives. We have physical constraints, and we have to focus on all that stuff as well. So that is baked into our training. That is baked into our processes now, and that carries our core values across.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). And what impact has that had on your team?
Scott Lesak
 Say in retention. Everybody knows that it's tough getting labor right now. And we were having a hard time getting new people through the door. We shifted our focus from getting new people to taking care of existing. Our most powerful recruitment tool we have today is retention. If we have people, keep them. If we can't get people, we already know that, so let's keep who we have. And with that, our retention rate's over 90%. And our people don't leave from being unhappy.
Scott Lesak
 I couldn't tell you the last time somebody quit because they were unhappy with the company. The last person that left here was a degreed computer programmer who wanted to get back into programming computers. Can't fault him on that one bit. And the conversation went, ""Go ahead. Let your wings fly, man. That's awesome. Follow your dreams. That's what we want to see. That's where we want to see you go."" But what we're experiencing now is a sense of attraction as well.
Scott Lesak
 People are coming to us. ""Hey, my buddy is this guy who works on your crew. Hey, my buddy is this guy, and he tells me about it. I really want to see what you guys have more to do."" And we just hired another salesperson yesterday, and somebody that's going to be a GM in training to replace some of my daily tasks that I'm doing on the... I don't know if you want to call it operations, admin or whatever. I'm in a really funny gray area of my career right now. I don't really know what I do, but I do a ton every day.
Scott Lesak
 So anyway, he's going to help me redefine that a little bit. But the guy's an extremely highly qualified salesperson, extremely highly qualified, worked as a business consultant for six years, and a very reputable company that he came from. And he came in and was in a white collar world for a long time, moved over to blue collar, and is working at a rental center right now, and just didn't enjoy the culture of the rental center.
Scott Lesak
 He missed the white collar culture, but wants to be doing blue collar work. And what he said at the end of the interview was, ""You're exactly what I'm looking for. You have a white collar culture in a blue collar industry. That's exactly what I've been look looking for."" And that was a new concept for me. Nobody's ever said that, or put that into words like that for us, but that's exactly what we have. We have a white collar culture in a blue collar industry, and it's powerful.
Scott Lesak
 It's extremely powerful. I know a couple other guys in the industry that are doing very similar things to us, but not many. There's only a couple, a handful of us that are doing this, and that's going to be powerful in the future. That's really going to be a turning point, and a lot more people are going to be doing exactly what we're doing after they see the successes of how well this works.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. That's amazing. And how big is the size of your team? How many people do you have?
Scott Lesak
 15.
Kim Oswalt
 15. Okay.
Scott Lesak
 Yeah.
Kim Oswalt
 Cool. So I was going to ask... I remember seeing something on your website about just the level of communication that you have with clients.
Scott Lesak
 Yep.
Kim Oswalt
 And so, when you mentioned the white collar thing, it made me think of that. So tell me just about what that is, or what communication processes are that make you stand out.
Scott Lesak
 Radical transparency and radical honesty. Stole that directly from Ray Dalio and his principles, but radical transparency and radical honesty is exactly what that comes down to. We tell our clients everything. We tell them when we mess up. If we hit their corner of their house and break some siding, we take a picture of it and text it to them. Or if they're home, we knock at the door and say, ""Hey, we just broke your siding. We know. We're going to fix it."" But that way, we're proactively pointing it out.
Scott Lesak
 We damaged this. Absolutely owning this. We will get it fixed for you. And that changes everything. ""Oh, wow. Okay. I don't even know if I would've noticed that. Oh, great. Thank you,"" to, ""Oh, I did notice that. Hey, your guys hit the side of my house. Why didn't anybody tell me?"" And it's a drastic change in the dynamic of that conversation. When we're... I'll back up to the initial process, the sales process, the prospecting process even. We're open. We're honest.
Scott Lesak
 ""Here's what we have to offer to help your business. Here's what we have to offer to beautify your backyard."" ""No, thanks. I'm really not interested in that at this time."" ""Okay. Thank you. If anything changes in the future, let's pick this conversation up. I really enjoyed talking to you."" No pressure in the sales. We approach sales... Everybody talks about value sales, and it's very important. Value sales, not price sales. That's how we sell. We sell our value.
Scott Lesak
 But the way we get our value across is, we actually take the approach of consultative sales. So we go in and treat ourselves as consultants right away, because when anybody calls a landscaper, they're calling a contractor in their subconscious mind. So we go in and present ourselves as a consultant who cares about their exterior, who cares about their desires, and that immediately changes the vibe that we're putting off and the relationship from day one.
Scott Lesak
 Then, we sell the design for the design build side, or then we go through and do the takeoffs for the maintenance side and make sure everything... And we tell the clients every step of the way what we're doing. We're going to be coming out to do the takeoffs on your site this day at 10:00 AM. And guess what? We're there promptly at 10:00 AM, because they have cameras everywhere. They're inside. They know exactly when we're there, and if we show up at 11:00, that's a reflection of our company not coming through on our words.
Scott Lesak
 And we're not taking the approach of the plumbers and the other people that, ""Oh yeah, we'll have somebody out there tomorrow for you between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM. It'll be sometime in that window."" And it's like no, we're going to be there to the minute, right now. This is exactly when we're going to get there.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Scott Lesak
 And we come through on that. And we're going to deliver you a price by 12:00 noon on February 7th, and it will be there by 11:30 or 12:00 noon on February 27th. We're building trust. We're building honesty.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Scott Lesak
 We're showing how honest and how integral and reliable we are, before we even get to the build portion or the service portion of this. Then the service operations managers talking, saying, ""Hey, we're doing this on your site today. Hey, we did this today. Hey, we ran into this. Hey, we're a day behind right now because we hit this issue. Your materials are delayed."" That's been a big one for the past year. Your materials are delayed. Here's what's happening. We don't know when we're going to be there. ""This is not on us. This is on our suppliers. I will keep you in the loop as much as we get updates,"" and just being transparent and honest.
Scott Lesak
 So many people hide. So many people get scared of, ""Oh, I can't get the materials. I'm going to ghost this guy for a little while until I have the materials. Then I'll tell him when we'll be there."" And that just... That breeds resentment. That breeds a negative atmosphere and culture around everything then.
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah, definitely. So what impact has that had on your customer relationships?
Scott Lesak
 It's tremendous, absolutely tremendous. I would say directly, we really... We retain clients. And at the same time, we lose clients that don't fit that. We lose the people that are shopping for price and don't value what our consultation is, that don't value what we bring to the table. And that's okay. We have that constructed for a reason. If you're not a good fit, you essentially pre-screen yourself instead of us having to say no at this point. We still get to people that we do have to say no, but our clients are more like friends.
Scott Lesak
 And we're in the landscape business. I'd be lying to you if I told you we didn't lose clients every year. It happens, and there's going to be differences, moral differences, ethical differences, performance expectation differences. That's the reality of our industry. So I'd be lying to you if I told you we don't lose clients, but we don't lose many, and we keep a ton. And we keep going back year after year to a lot of the same people because of that.
Scott Lesak
 And they don't shop around. That's the beauty of it. As we start building that, we are the relied on people. We are trusted. They trust our pricing. They know they're going to get a fair price. Whenever our pricing gets questioned, our answer is directly, ""Here's where your costs are coming from."" We won't show them the entire bid, because that's really complex and can point out stuff that you don't want to get questions about. But we'll talk about how many labor hours we have in there, what we're doing with the materials, the profit that we're making, because we're in business to make money.
Scott Lesak
 We're not in business to be a charity, but that profit has to be fair for both of us. We have to make enough money to be able to grow, but we don't want to charge you too much money that we're ripping you off. And that's how we explain it. We're just transparent about that whole thing. And if that works, and we get the sale from it, awesome. If that doesn't work, tough luck. We're not working with you because we're not bending on our pricing. We need that to stay in business, and if we're not making the right amount of money, our guys might as well stay home that day, because it's not worth it for any of us.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. And obviously, this industry is generally pretty low margin. But what has your experience with that been like? And has it changed at all with Aspire?
Scott Lesak
 Yes. So our margins have definitely honed in, I will say, with Aspire. We've been able to pinpoint. We shoot for around a 60% margin on our maintenance accounts, gross margin. And we pinpointed maintenance accounts that were making 32% gross margins this year. I'm like, ""Holy crap. We are literally paying that person to do their landscaping right now. We've got to change this or get rid of them. That doesn't work."" And then, we've had the opposite end that's like, ""Whoa, that one's at an 85% gross margin. We're overcharging that person. We've got to balance the scale a little bit.""
Scott Lesak
 And over the years, that extreme low end to the extreme high end was never pinpointed. It worked out in the numbers, so we never really saw it, and we were always like, ""Yeah, we're making money. Great. This is awesome."" But when you can actually pinpoint each one, it's like, ""That guy's actually paying way too much for our services, and I'll humbly admit that. That one's not paying even close to enough, and they've been an issue for us anyway, so let's give them that price increase, and if it doesn't go well, then we're not working with them any more anyway. No problem.""
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. That's great. So what are some of the challenges that you've faced over the past few years of the business?
Scott Lesak
 Oh man. Challenges happen every day. Failures happen every day. Mistakes happen every day. We embrace those. We embrace the challenges. We embrace the failures. We embrace the mistakes. And we start from experience instead of starting over again when we reach those. Some of the specific challenges that we have faced... I would throw Aspire into that. Onboarding with Aspire and implementing Aspire and getting good at Aspire has been a huge challenge.
Scott Lesak
 It's been a positive challenge, but there has been a lot of frustrations with that. There have been a lot of successes with that. There has been a lot of neutral ground with that, and it has been a huge challenge, but a challenge worth everything that we went through to get to where we are. People have been a challenge. Learning how to deal with our people and learning how to do all of this positive mindset, positive training that I'm talking about, that was definitely a challenge to implement that. I had a lot of imposter syndrome personally, when I was trying to implement that, of thinking, ""I'm not qualified enough to be pushing this stuff across to these guys.""
Scott Lesak
 And that couldn't have been further from the truth, the further in we get, and just sharing my personal experiences has been enough to change people. But that was really challenging, getting that implemented. Figuring out just jumping off a couple of the ledges that you have to jump off of when you're going from... I look at this landscape businesses, any businesses, are tiered. Zero to 500,000, I don't care if you've been in business for two months or 20 years, that's a startup [inaudible 00:33:22] You're still a startup. You're an owner operator. You're doing everything. 500,000 to a million, you need to start delegating.
Scott Lesak
 You need to start having other people helping you do stuff, instead of just being the owner operator. One to 3 million is a huge one, because you start getting the systems and processes in place, you start getting things in place, but you have no idea how much stuff needs to change and how much money those changes are going to cost to go from one million to 3 million until you're working through that. So that's been a challenge, and figuring that out. Figuring out what positions to fill, and we're talking high paid salary positions at this point that have to be filled, not lower paid labor positions that are easy to mess up a little bit.
Scott Lesak
 I mean, you need to know exactly where your numbers are to hire somebody in it at 50, 60, 70 thousand dollars a year plus commission. So that's been challenging, figuring that out and getting the courage up to just jump and do it and figure it out, and being humble enough to admit when you make a mistake there and go backwards and fix it.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. And what are some of the biggest lessons that you've learned?
Scott Lesak
 Biggest lesson... The number one biggest lesson that I have learned is, failure and challenge is a good thing. Really good thing. We embrace failure. We embrace challenges. We don't want to see it happen. I don't want to sound like we're, ""Oh yeah. Fail at this, fail at that, make those mistakes."" We don't want to see it happen, but when it does happen, we have a great process to recover from that and learn from that. And some of the most valuable lessons we've learned in business, some of the biggest milestones of growth, have happened immediately after a failure or a mistake, that we learned from that mistake and moved on, persevered, and we were able to overcome it and do really well in the end.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). And what goals do you have for the business in the next say, five years?
Scott Lesak
 So that's a great question. We're continuing our growth. We have a very systemized growth approach that we're going after. So our growth goal this year is 2.5 million. Growth goal for next year is going to be 3.5 million. Within five years, we want to be at 10 million. That's what we're pushing for right now, and we're systematically getting there. We have processes driving that. We have discussed acquisitions. We're not sure. We haven't found the right people to acquire quite yet, but that is definitely on the table to aid in the growth, because we realize with how aggressively we are growing, that might be a way to speed it up and make it a little bit easier for us.
Scott Lesak
 So that's definitely on the table. One of my biggest goals is, step stepping back further from the company. The company keeps doing better and better the further back I get, which is really cool. We lay the foundation, and then we let people fly within those positions, and I want to be able to spend more time with my wife and my family. I don't want to be married to my business. I want to be married to my wife, and be able to give my family the life that they deserve, and really as business owners, that's what we should be working towards.
Scott Lesak
 We bought into these businesses as an investment. We bought into them to financially free ourselves, and so many people get caught up in the day to day that, you bought yourself a job. You didn't buy yourself an investment when you're still working within the company. So I really, over the next five years, want to transfer this into a full investment instead of being a job for me.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. That's a great goal. It's a big goal.
Scott Lesak
 Yeah, absolutely.
Kim Oswalt
 But that's exciting. What are the resources that you're finding helpful? I know you mentioned that you had gone to school for this kind of, but not necessarily the business side. I feel like, I've talked to a lot of people who are in business owner roles now, who have the landscaping background.
Scott Lesak
 Yeah.
Kim Oswalt
 But all of the business knowledge you kind of just had to cobble together. So I'm just curious, what resources you've used in that process.
Scott Lesak
 Books. Books. Audiobooks. I really don't use my college degree at all anymore. At one point in time, I could identify hundreds of trees, hundreds of plants, genus, species, common name, all of it. I could do it all. And I haven't really been massaging those skills much lately, so my skillset that I learned in college is dwindling a little bit from that side. However, the best thing I learned in college was how to learn. I learned the skill of learning. I learned how to research. I learned how to go after things, and that's what I attribute the business growth to.
Scott Lesak
 That's what I attribute the business knowledge to. I know how to learn. I know where to go, and if I don't know to go, I know where to find how to get to where I need to go, and that has been really revolutionary, really monumental. I had a very impactful mentor. Name is Dan Sterns, in college. He was the head professor. Unfortunately, he just passed away about two months ago, but he always taught us, learn how to learn. Go find the answers yourself. You ask him a question, and he'd be like, ""Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I know that answer. So why don't you go find it yourself? And then, let's talk about it.""
Scott Lesak
 And just his attitude with that, it was completely sincere. Completely, ""Yeah, I want to help you, but go find the answer because that's going to get you more value than me just giving it to you."" And then, you can sit down and have conversation with him, and that was hugely impactful. And that's how I still learn today. That's how I approach everything. There's a way to learn. To directly answer your question, I listen to audio books all the time.
Scott Lesak
 I live 45 minutes away from my office. I have an hour and a half of windshield time every single day, that I'm coming in and out of the office. I listen to audio books instead of music. I'm a drummer. I enjoy playing music. I enjoy listening to music, but I have shifted that from doing that in my vehicle, to doing that while I'm playing the drums, doing that after hours when I'm in my basement, in the music space, instead of listening to it in my car.
Scott Lesak
 And that hour and a half drive has turned into work time for me now. It is productive time instead of just sitting there. And I have listened to probably 30 books in the last six months. That's a guess at that number, but it's got to be up there, and just listening to different stuff. E-Myth sparked that. E-Myth hands down, anybody reading or listening to this that hasn't been through E-Myth in business, needs to get through that book. But then getting into John Maxwell, leadership stuff, getting into Zig Ziegler, getting into Simon Sinek and just reading as many of those as we can.
Scott Lesak
 Robert Kiosaki, Rich Dad Poor Dad, that's a great book for both financial side of things and personal growth. He covers both of them in there. That's a tremendous value. And then, taking the principles that I learn from those books and regurgitating them and putting them into action. That's the big thing. We can listen to the books. We can get as many principles into our head as we can. If we don't take the action to actually do something with it, it's just useless information for us.
Scott Lesak
 So that's the difference. You have to take the action. And I'll go back through books that I'm very impacted by, and they're giving loads of work sheet time or loads of tasks, like, ""Do this now. Do that now."" I'll pause that while I'm driving and save that for later, and do that one while I'm not driving, so I can actually do the activities that they're suggesting and listen to one that's less involved while I'm driving then.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, that's great. And you had also mentioned kind of experiencing some imposter syndrome as you grow the business. What is something that has helped you overcome that?
Scott Lesak
 I mean, all the personal growth stuff. Just being confident, getting comfortable being uncomfortable. That's a big one. Just step outside of your comfort zone, and the more confidently I speak, the more confidently I deliver messages, the more confidently I train, the more I realize how valuable the information that I passed off was, and how much the person that I passed it to didn't understand it.
Scott Lesak
 One of the biggest mistakes I have made in my professional career is thinking other people think like me, and not many people think like me. And that's probably a good thing, because you don't want to get up inside my head. It's a crazy place. It probably looks... If I could imagine, it looks like that gnarly wooded area in Sleeping Beauty as they're going through the dark forest. That's probably what my head looks like, but that's okay, and I understand that. And I am done doubting myself. I'm very confident in the knowledge I have, and I'm very confident in the humility that I have to not answer something that I'm not confident in answering.
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah. That's great. And then, we're almost at the end of our time here, but I didn't ask you at the beginning much about how you got started in your business. So way back at the beginning, I think you said 2004-
Scott Lesak
 Yeah.
Kim Oswalt
 So maybe just talk about that part. What made you want to start your own business? Did you work for somebody else first, or did you just kind of break out on your own to begin with?
Scott Lesak
 Yeah. So 2004, I was 17. So just to put that in perspective. My landscape journey actually started in 2001 when I was 14, just doing stuff for neighbors, doing stuff. I lived in a pretty agricultural area, so it wasn't like a development, but I did have neighbors at the same time. So one of my friends lived in a development, so he and I worked together. And it was 100% financially based. We were teenage kids wanting to make some money. So that was exactly how we got into it.
Scott Lesak
 My friend that I was working with during that time went out and worked for somebody else then for a little bit, and I decided I didn't want to do that. I had other stuff going on in my life as that rambunctious teenager that I didn't want to work for a landscape company. And 2004 was when it really kicked off. My dad was instrumental in getting me into the industry. He was not a landscaper. He was a consultant in a very, very different field, but he built a really cool front yard at the house that I grew up in. Huge paver driveway.
Scott Lesak
 I want to say it was like 4,200 square foot paver driveway, boulder work, steps, plantings, rock walls, masonry stuff. I mean, it had everything from the build side into this project, and it took all summer to build it. And I helped him with that process, and I really enjoyed what we created. And we talked about it, and we're like, ""Hey, there there's some money in this."" And my dad was like, ""Well, you were interested in landscaping before. Why don't I help you start a business?"" So 2004, he established a sole proprietorship for me, to help me get my feet wet into business.
Scott Lesak
 At that point, I determined I was either going to keep running with the business. I really enjoyed what I was doing. I made enough money that I bought a four wheeler, I bought a snowmobile, and I was starting to reap the rewards of some of the stuff that I was doing, and I decided I was either going to Penn State for landscape contracting, or I was continuing to run the company. Those were my only two options. I was not going anywhere else for anything else.
Scott Lesak
 Penn State for landscape contracting was where I was going, or I wasn't going to college. Retrospect, I'm really happy I got in, because that probably would've been a bad decision, but... So fast forward to when I graduated in 2011, we established the LLC Castle Rocks Landscape Company that we're operating under today. And we're still 50-50 owners. My dad is involved. He was much more actively involved during the timeframe that I just described, and he is a absolutely completely a silent partner partner right now.
Scott Lesak
 He does nothing with the business day to day, except for come out and play with the skid steer and mini excavator every now and then. We'll catch him out in the yard digging holes. But other than that, he really helped me. He got me into this. He gave me the drive. To just say him, is an understatement and undervalues my mom, because it was definitely the team of the two of them just encouraging me and saying, ""Yeah, go do that. Yeah, here's a little bit of money. If you need help..."" And it wasn't a lot of money. I didn't come from a rich family.
Scott Lesak
 We're not... We're talking a couple hundred to a couple thousand bucks here and there. We're not talking millions of dollars to invest in this company. And they really gave it their all, and really had faith in me. So that helped me drastically.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. No, that's huge. Well, very cool. I think those were kind of the big things that I had to ask you about. Is there anything that I didn't mention that you might want to talk about?
Scott Lesak
 No. I think we hit a lot. That was a whole lot.
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah.
Scott Lesak
 I mean, I definitely have more time. We don't have to cut it off right now if you did have other questions, but I don't really have anything specifically for you.
Kim Oswalt
 Perfect. No, I think that's good. I did... So I assume the name is just your name backwards?
Scott Lesak
 Yep.
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah.
Scott Lesak
 And that was 100% my dad. I can't take credit for that one. Every time that comes up, I've got to give him credit. That was him. And we started out as a hardscape company doing boulder installs, doing rock installs, and doing the pavers and everything. So 2001 to 2004, we called ourselves Castle Rocks Rock scapes, with was a DBA under my dad's consulting company. And then, we got to the point that we were making tens of thousands instead of thousands, and we were like, ""All right, we should probably establish a separate business for that.""
Scott Lesak
 Then we turned into Castle Rocks Landscape, or Castle Rocks Landscaping is what we were as the sole proprietorship then. And it was just, the Castle worked out and the rocks build castles, and it just kind of all tied together and worked out really well.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). That's great.
Scott Lesak
 So that's the quick, abbreviated history of that name.
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah. I assumed something like that, but yeah, that's pretty cool. I guess I could also ask... You mentioned at the top, the areas that you focus on, but what does your service mix look like?
Scott Lesak
 So right now, we're really pushing from a scalability aspect, commercial maintenance. We do a lot of snow and ice management. In Pennsylvania, where the year over year is always different because we have some killer winters, and we have some really lousy winters, and my definition of that's probably different than the most to the public's. The killer winter is when we have a lot of snow, and the lousy winters when we don't have snow.
Scott Lesak
 But last year, 2021, about 40% of our revenue came from snow and ice. And that's really a big area of what we do. Commercial maintenance... Let's get snow and ice out of here from there, and we'll get us by up to 100% value for the green season stuff. Commercial maintenance is about 30% of our revenue right now, and we really are pushing to go the complete opposite direction, have that be 70%, and then have the build be 30%. And build has gotten us here, and build is really our passion and our roots.
Scott Lesak
 However, to continue to grow and to continue to experience profitability and the scalability that we have, maintenance is easier to scale. Build is very highly skilled. It's hard to find people that really want to do the build work. It's hard to find people anywhere right now, but it's a much higher detail, higher skilled portion of the trade than the maintenance. And I don't want to downplay how much you need to know for maintenance too. There's a lot of skills that go into maintenance, but what we do in our hardscapes with walls and pavers and putting footers under fireplaces and all that, is borderline engineering.
Scott Lesak
 You need to have a next level understanding of exactly what the compaction principles are, the strengths of concrete, and all that type of stuff. So it's really a much more expansive skillset.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Scott Lesak
 So yeah, we're about 30% maintenance, about 10 to 15 percent enhancement, and then the rest is build.
Kim Oswalt
 Got it. And who would you consider your ideal clients right now?
Scott Lesak
 Ideal clients right now are... So for the maintenance side, we are getting [inaudible 00:48:17] facilities. I'm sorry. Warehouse facilities, industrial facilities. We are not touching HOAs. We are not touching apartment complexes. Any type of residential, we do not want for maintenance. And in our market, we have a ton of warehouses. We have a ton of industry. So we're in a really good niche pocket to focus on that.
Scott Lesak
 So our ideal clients are warehouse and industrial clients for maintenance, and then class A office buildings, class A real estate office buildings. That's what we focus on for maintenance, and we don't even take anything else on anymore. For build, we're looking for people with home values of half a million dollars and greater. We're looking for people that want to pay for our design services to get a high quality design for a high quality landscape, and we're looking for people that are looking to invest in their homes, not people that are price shopping, looking to get the best deal on a patio in their backyard.
Scott Lesak
 We want people that are willing to partner with us to care about the exterior of their houses.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). And where are the majority of your leads coming from right now?
Scott Lesak
 So we spend a good amount on Google AdWords. We get a lot of stuff off Google. The sales team... For maintenance, our sales team is drumming everything up. Boots on the ground, prospecting, going out, building relationships. In my opinion, in my experience, it's the best way, and it's the only way. There's all kinds of lead generation services out there, but for commercial work, you've got to start earning that repertoire. You've got to start earning your wings, so to speak, with those clients for years in advance of them actually signing a contract.
Scott Lesak
 And the best way to do that is get in front of them face to face. Excuse me, sorry. The build side is where a lot of the Google AdWords come in, and that's a lot harder to prospect. You can't go around and knock at every door, ""Hey, do you want a patio? Hey, do you want a beautiful backyard? Hey, I noticed you're getting a pool."" Actually, that one does work sometimes. ""Hey, I noticed you're getting a pool. What are you getting? What are you doing around it?""
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Scott Lesak
 So that's where the Google AdWords come in, and have people drum up business through our website, have people come to us for that. And we have great results with that, and we have a very detailed process of how to acquire those people, how to screen those people, and usually when we get in a process, by the time we're actually putting effort into that process, it's a pretty sure sale right off the bat.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). And as far as the makeup of your team right now, how is it... What kinds of roles do you have, and which... How are you looking to grow all of those areas?
Scott Lesak
 Yeah, that's a great question. That's a big part of the scalability and the scale first thing. So we have management. We have a killer management team. We have a VP of operations. We have a VP of design build. And those two guys, that's their official title. That's what they're growing into. The VP of design build is really a designer, and selling the design work right now. That's what his actual day to day is, but he's also developing the processes to build more designers underneath him and continue to carry that out.
Scott Lesak
 VP of operations has been with us for 11 years. He has been in every position the company has to offer. He has been my right hand, man, and he has been through everything. Everything that I've been through, he's been through with me, and he is our estimator and our bidder right now. He is helping our operations manager, which is the next position we'll talk about, learn the ropes and learn how to manage everything. He also handles some of the admin work
Scott Lesak
 He and I work together on month end and Aspire and those areas. And then, we have the operations manager, and he's responsible for material acquisition, crew scheduling, work tickets, work ticket clean up, and doing a lot of the operational side of things for month end in Aspire as well as getting all the job costing data in, getting everything to invoicing assistance, so we can send the in invoices out once it gets to that point.
Scott Lesak
 And he's really an imperative role. And that role, that operations manager, the way we're running it right now, could be viewed as a hybrid role of an account manager and a project manager. That's essentially the duties that he's performing both of right now. And as we grow, we're going to fill those two positions underneath him, so he will be managing an account manager, two account managers, three account managers, and project manager underneath him.
Scott Lesak
 That in nutshell, is our management structure right now. Yesterday, we just hired another salesperson who is going to be focusing 100% on commercial work. So that person will be starting on February 14th. So he's joining our team as well. Another one we're talking about right now, is an office manager. We stayed away from the office manager. We outsourced all of our bookkeeping, and outsourced as much as we could, and one thing we are finding with Aspire is we can't outsource Aspire.
Scott Lesak
 There's really nobody out there doing exactly what we need to for month end and for the bookkeeping and everything. So that role will be getting filled in the near future as well. And that builds our core management team. Then, when we move down into the operations, crew leaders. That's the next level. And there's a position that's going to get created for a production manager on that side, which is kind of a hybrid position between a crew leader and a project or account manager. It's going to be right in the middle there, doing a lot of field work, keeping eye on quality assurance and production rates and everything.
Scott Lesak
 So we're hoping to fill that. We already have the guy picked out. He's already agreed to take that position. We have to just reach the stage of growth that it makes sense for us to actually put him in that position. Right now, he's currently a crew leader for us. So those crew leaders then, they're running the Crew Mobile though. They're reading the plans on the build stuff. They're knowing exactly what more to put in what space on our maintenance accounts, and they're running the leadership portion of the field work.
Scott Lesak
 And underneath them, we have the crew members. We have the team members. And those guys are learning as much as they can. They're the boots on the ground getting stuff done, and we're getting to a point that our crew members and our crew leaders are very similar skillsets right now. So we're at a really powerful point to be able to add a whole lot of new people and have enough crew leaders in position on a skillset level to be able to add those people. So that's essentially in a nutshell, how our hierarchy works.
Scott Lesak
 I've skipped myself. And I'm above, and my direct reports are essentially the operations manager, VP of ops, and the VP of design build. Those are the three guys that I work with hand in hand on a daily basis, and really help coach them, help consult them, help them do their roles more effectively. And in turn, they do the exact same thing for me. They coach me. They talk me off of ledges. They consult me when I overreact to certain things.
Scott Lesak
 They pull me by in and say, ""Hey man..."" Because the reality, we as leaders at the top, we still need to be led. We still need accountability. So if I could give one takeaway to anybody listening or reading this, if you're at the top, make sure you have an accountability team. Pick out people and say, ""I want you to keep me accountable."" You need that.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, that's huge. So I do like to ask people at the end, if they had to give an elevator pitch for Aspire to somebody who was on the fence about it, considering business management software for their landscape company, what's something that you would tell them?
Scott Lesak
 I would tell them that it is transformative for the business. It will transform the way you talk about your business, the way you understand your business, the way you understand the numbers of your business, the way you estimate, and the way you literally live, because of the way that you're able to streamline certain things. I would also point out a few of the frustrations that we've had, like the employee portal has been pretty lousy for us, but that negative definitely does not outweigh all the positives that we have in other areas.
Scott Lesak
 And we're having a lot of difficulty in snow ice management right now within it. The system's not really built for snow and ice management, so I always like to go with the positives and the negatives, and those are the two struggles that we have. We're getting paid slower through Aspire than we ever were when we were running through QuickBooks, because it's not as easy to pay us.
Scott Lesak
 And that's a big issue for us. And the snow and ice management is taking forever to invoice, and it is just really not intuitive for the way that we're managing that. However, even saying that stuff, the power of the program, the job costing, the numbers that we know, the flexibility and scalability we have for pricing and invoicing, to be able to just plug and play and teach people how to use it after we have a kit set up the right way, all of that far outweighs any of those negatives that I just brought up.
Kim Oswalt
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). Did any of the snow updates this past year help?
Scott Lesak
 This is our first year doing snow in it. So I can't tell you.
Kim Oswalt
 Oh, so I guess it wouldn't... Yeah.
Scott Lesak
 Yeah.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay.
Scott Lesak
 So from what we used to do, it's better. Yeah. Yeah. IT's a lot slower, more cumbersome than what my expectation was. We'll put it that way.
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah. I got you. Do you guys meet with a CSM monthly? I think your CSM is Peggy, right? Peggy Hughes?
Scott Lesak
 Yeah.
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah?
Scott Lesak
 So we just got assigned Peggy last week. I actually just got off a call with her right before we had this.
Kim Oswalt
 Oh, okay.
Scott Lesak
 So yeah, she's been helping. She's great. We had Emily Nickel before Peggy, and Emily was absolutely awesome, and it sounds like she got a tremendous opportunity, so I'm really happy for her. But we were in limbo for a little bit, but Peggy is now assigned to us, so-
Kim Oswalt
 Okay. Cool. I always like to check, because sometimes people don't have those monthly meetings set up, and I feel like our CSMs can just be so helpful.
Scott Lesak
 Oh yeah. Absolutely. And we also work with Dave Gallagher. He's our consultant. So he's really helped us set up the system. I don't know if you're familiar with him or Spiritus Business Advisors, but he's been paramount. I mean, he really through implementation and everything... He was our translator, because the implementation, understood the language, and we didn't. And he was really our translator and helped us set stuff up. So that was really really helpful for us too.
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah. Okay. Great. Well, here. I'll stop recording this, because we're done-"
https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/Q1Sn9OfwC5VX1Hqt57rGd4vwEDdizpnsmPKMHSHzqHGC3R2h9p2IzZ7ZdtOKncmdgsX3gYA--xMnDHtdn60bBb-8Mt8?loadFrom=SharedLink,"Abby Hart
 The recording, Niwar, I hope it's okay.
Niwar Nasim
 Of course.
Abby Hart
 So, let's dive in. You've already so thoughtfully provided answers to many of these questions, so thank you so much. Just a couple of clarifying things. Nasim and Sons onboarded with Aspire September 2020. Is that accurate?
Niwar Nasim
 That's correct. We started the official onboarding, correct.
Abby Hart
 Okay, perfect. That's what I was able to get out of our records on our side. How many employees do you have, Niwar?
Niwar Nasim
 Currently, we're at 60.
Abby Hart
 60? Great. And there is one headquarters with the potential, or it sounds like a second location is on the horizon. Is that accurate?
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah, that's accurate.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Niwar Nasim
 Our headquarters is just off of Seattle. We haven't quite opened up our satellite facility yet, but it will be in about a couple of months or so.
Abby Hart
 Okay. Where is that location?
Niwar Nasim
 Well, it's Lacey, but it's a town just outside of Olympia, which is a capital of Washington State.
Abby Hart
 Got it.
Ben Sanders
 Niwar, I lived in the Northwest for 25 years. I lived in Bellingham and Seattle.
Niwar Nasim
 You did?
Ben Sanders
 Yeah. Very familiar. Grew up in Federal Way.
Niwar Nasim
 So, I live in Puyallup. So, you obviously know very well.
Ben Sanders
 Yeah. My parents lived there for 30 years.
Niwar Nasim
 Wow! Where are you at, Ben?
Ben Sanders
 I'm in Central Texas now.
Niwar Nasim
 I've got you. Very cool. Wow! Small world, man.
Ben Sanders
 I'm even more curious about your business now.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah, absolutely. Happy to share, man. Absolutely.
Abby Hart
 Niwar, I might actually have you turn off your video just in case it helps with the audio, because I could hear it breaking up there. So, I'm going to have you turn off your video just in case it's helpful.
Niwar Nasim
 You've got it. Let me know how that goes.
Abby Hart
 Perfect. All right. Great. So, let's see. We have your customer mix and service mix. You only have residential for design build. The rest is all commercial, correct?
Niwar Nasim
 That's correct. We only do essentially just projects for more of a high end clientele base for residential.
Abby Hart
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). And you run the company with your wife. What is your wife's name?
Niwar Nasim
 Shilan, S-H-I-L-A-N.
Abby Hart
 I'm sorry. Could you spell that again?
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. S-H-I-L-A-N. So, it's like Shilan.
Abby Hart
 Shilan? Perfect. All right. Great. And what is her title?
Niwar Nasim
 She's currently a stay at home mom and full-time grad student in MBA program, but she's actually our controller. And she's taking a little bit of a leave right now, but essentially she's our controller.
Abby Hart
 Got it. But, she's been your controller since 2011 and only recently?
Niwar Nasim
 More in that role, I would say, in the last three years. Before that, really we weren't quite at that point.
Abby Hart
 Got it. great. Phenomenal. So, you touched a little bit on, ""Describe a day in the life of your company."" Is there anything that you wanted to add to your written answer, Niwar, just to set the stage and the background for Nasim and Son's story? I mean, you and your family, refugees from Iraq, and then started the company in 1998. Is there any other background that you'd like to add that tell the story of Nasim and Sons?
Niwar Nasim
 Not really, to be honest. I mean, it's the typical coming to the country and realizing the American dream. And I know that sounds like a cliche these days, but truly, that's been my story. I mean, I do live in the American dream. Certainly I've experienced it. I'm living it and it's a true story. I live in it. So, I mean, I had the opportunity to grow up here at the age of 10 years old and went to school. Really never had Summers, never knew what weekends were because that's all we ever did was landscape and helped the family put food on the table. And I ended up going through the school system and ended up going to college on an athletic scholarship and all of that and thought that I was going to do something completely different.
And then, that economy crash happened in '07, '08, and nobody was hiring college grads with no experience. And so, I was really good at landscaping and mowing lawns and I enjoyed it. And my dad had, most of his business, all of his eggs in one basket going with a large daycare chain. It was KinderCare actually. And at that time, all the big companies were tightening their belts and they went with the big guys, BrightView. And at the time [inaudible 00:05:26]. And I remember that was such a devastating blow because it was literally 90 plus percent of my dad's business gone. It was just a decision. It was just gone. And I remember it was literally devastating.
I mean, it devastated the family and he didn't have the energy to build back up. He was already in his late 60s. I mean, he just wasn't there and I needed a job. And there was two trucks and a bunch of used equipment and I'm like, ""Dad, I want to do this."" And we had the father son handshake deal like ""Pay me back the cost for these mowers and these trucks and do your thing."" And here we are, 10, 11 years later. And, my gosh! I get goosebumps thinking about it, because it really feels surreal. So, anyway, I could go on in a lot of detail. I'll spare you guys that, unless you ask me.
Abby Hart
 What did you think you were going to do, Niwar?
Niwar Nasim
 I always thought I was going to be an executive, because before I got into landscaping, I got out and I ended up working at Target and I really wanted to be a department manager. And I don't interview well. I never did. And I had all of the qualifications, but I couldn't get through their very interesting interview process. And so, they saw some potential in me, so they put me at this junior level manager position. And then, I quickly started getting promoted literally within a couple of months, but it was like I was in a box all day. Literally, I'd go to work at 5:30, I'd come back at 6:30 in the evening.
I'm like, ""Dude, I'm in a box. I don't want to do this anymore."" So, it was seven months I was there. I was like, ""I'm going to go into landscaping."" And I like to share a story that ... It was pretty, because I remember, at that time, it was 2010, 2011, and things were starting to rebound slowly. And I remember when I just got into landscaping, we had bought a small route. Ben would probably know this place, a little company out of Gig Harbor. And the guy had 18 or 19 houses for maintenance. I bought a couple of pieces of his equipment. And so, I was like, ""Oh, I'm going to buy a company.""
And so, I bought this guys' little route. And I remember doing his properties and it was one really warm Summer. And I was at this property with another guy that helped me at the time. It was literally just myself and a part-time guy. And I was at this property and it was a really tough property to maintain and I was line trimming. And these people had these dogs. I don't know what breed they were, but they were the most unattractive dogs you could find. I don't know what they were, man. It was like some alien looking type dogs. It was crazy. And they were the most disrespectful people. They were unappreciative and they always leave their dogs waste on the grass. And I was light trimming one day and I remember my line trimer hit the dog poo.
So, this is a little bit too much detail here, but I shared the story with a lot of people because what happened was I literally had dog waste all over my face and my body. And I remember it was a warm Summer, and then I froze. I literally froze. I was like, ""I'm a college grad."" I sat there and I froze. And I had this line trimer in my hand. I wanted to just throw it down the hill and just call it quits, call it a day. And I almost did, but I didn't. Literally, I don't know what I did to clean myself off, but for some reason I can never forget that moment because it was so easy to quit.
And I just stuck with it. And thankfully, that was the last time I had something like that ever happen to me of that nature. But, I've had other moments like that throughout the last 10 plus 11 years where I've wanted to quit. And point being is just adversity. You stick to something, you're going to have all kinds of crazy things happen to you and it's incredible. So, I hope I didn't bore you to death sharing that story. I hope you've got a kick out of it, but there's a meaning behind that. And so, that's why I share that.
Abby Hart
 I mean, on the other end, what are the moments where you're like, ""Yes. Landscaping, this is it for me""?
Niwar Nasim
 To be honest, it's just the entrepreneurial side of just being able to essentially call your own shots, you could say, for lack of better words, and just being able to ... In my case, we've been able to acquire real estate, and I've really done well with that. And I don't know if I'd be able to do that in a regular executive position at a place like Target or whatever. And so, the financial freedom is what I'm trying to say here, has been the big thing. And on top of all of that, to be honest, it's being able to do something that you just love. I love waking up at four in the morning and I cannot wait to get to the office. That's a dream to me. I don't dread going to work. My wife gives me a hard time. She's like, ""You enjoy work more than your family."" And it's crazy. I shouldn't be that way, but that work life balance, of course that's a whole separate subject anyway.
Abby Hart
 That's great. I feel like there are a lot of people in this industry that feel the same way you do, the that I've interviewed over the years. I used to work at Landscape Management. I was a senior editor there.
Niwar Nasim
 Is that right?
Abby Hart
 Yeah. And then, I came over and Aspire.
Niwar Nasim
 That's amazing.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. It's great. So, when did you first become aware that you needed software to run your business? You say that you knew as early as 2013, but what was the thing when you were like, ""We're terrible at this,"" or not, ""We're terrible,"" but like, ""Software will help us do X""? When did you first become aware that you needed software and why?
Niwar Nasim
 For sure. I mean, you mentioned Landscape Management Magazine, I would read those when I was in my early 20s, when my father was [inaudible 00:12:32]. We'd get those publications and I would sit there, and I remember it was interesting to me and I'm like, ""Wow! Look at these guys and all these companies and these stories."" And so, when I got into it in 2012, 2013, when I started realizing adding new properties, new customers, I'm realizing a spreadsheet isn't going to work anymore, and QuickBooks doesn't do these things that I want it to do, like scheduling. And it's the natural progression of growth. As you grow, you have more needs. And so, like a lot of people I was using literally spreadsheets at first.
And then, I said, ""Okay. Well, I'm going to automate this by doing my estimating out of QuickBooks."" And when I did that I was like, ""Wow! This is incredible. This is it. I'm done."" And then, you're like, ""Wait a minute. It doesn't schedule."" So now, at the time, I was hearing all about service autopilots and all these other different things, Jobber and all this stuff. And I don't know. I mean, I never really was fully bought in. I knew I needed something because I was looking for something that would help me schedule, because I always really sucked at scheduling, and then of course job costing. I never knew what the hell job costing was. I would always hear people talk about it until literally the 2019, 2020 is when we really truly started job costing.
And before that it was literally always just shooting from the hip. We were making money. I mean, we definitely were, because otherwise we wouldn't have been able to grow, but I never had a single clue how much, what type of margins, and if we lost, how much we lost. It was just literally trial and error. And that's how we built ourselves. And when we started really scaling fast forward in 2014 or 2015, I mean, it was scaling, but it was 2016 or maybe 2017 even, it might have been 16, we got on board with [Element 00:14:44]. And that was a huge deal too, because I was like, ""Wow! We could now budget."" And we never got to the scheduling side of that software because I just couldn't figure it out, or I don't know.
I just was so busy with other stuff. But, even that though, it was just not quite what ... In my opinion, it's more of a good for the design build guy and not so much for commercial maintenance and whatnot. So, I don't know. I mean, it was good for doing estimating and stuff like that and helping understand the concept of budgeting and why that was all important and automation and stuff like that. But, I looked into Aspire initially, like I said in the questionnaire, and I found out about it early on. My brother actually used to work at LandCare as an account manager, and so he was familiar with Aspire. That's when I first inquired about it, but it was so expensive at the time. I even got a proposal from them. I forget what year it was, but it was really expensive. Anyway, I might getting ahead myself with the question you asked, but just talking about the progression of starting off with the early days of QuickBooks and spreadsheets and eventually Element, and then ...
Abby Hart
 Niwar, I feel like I've lost you. Niwar? Ben, are you in [inaudible 00:16:17]?
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. Can you hear me okay.
Abby Hart
 Yes. Sorry.
Niwar Nasim
 That's okay. I don't know if you lost me or ...
Abby Hart
 Yeah. You were saying that after you got on board with Element something.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. Well, I don't know how much of that you lost.
Abby Hart
 It was just that last mention of Element.
Niwar Nasim
 Okay. Well, I was just saying from the early days of the spreadsheets to QuickBooks to Element and ultimately Aspire.
Abby Hart
 Great. Awesome. So Ben, do you have any follow up questions on that?
Ben Sanders
 No. I don't think so right now. Thanks.
Abby Hart
 All right. So, it sounds like scheduling was a major issue for you. What was the thing that you like best about Aspires scheduling when you onboarded with Aspire?
Niwar Nasim
 I mean, everything, to be honest, from the clicking dragging to just scheduling that for the whole year, setting your frequencies and tailoring that to your contracts. And I mean, I've seen almost all the videos of testimonials on Aspire. And when you ask me that question, I'm trying to use some different words, but so much of those words, I'm like ""These other people have said it,"" but customization. I mean, being able to customize the software to what the program or what type of a management plan that we want to give to a specific client, you can do that with Aspire. So, automation, customization. So, that's just on the scheduling side. And then, to be able to finally and truly be able to see job costs like, ""Are we really profitable at this property? Is this property as great as we think it is? Are we really making money here?""
I have had some really eye opening discoveries to put it that way, after we put a whole year into Aspire, looking back and saying, ""Damn! That was not a good property that we thought we were making money on for these last four years."" It's like, ""We're doing that at a 31% gross margin. And here we thought we were crushing it because it's a big account and it's commercial and everybody wants it because it's a high profiled account and etc."" Sorry. I had a call come through. But, that has been so crazy important. And I mean, you just see what you're doing. You see where you're making money and where you're not. And it's so much easier to make a decision, make important business decisions, and say, ""Man, we either have to have a very tough and frank conversation with this customer or it's time to say goodbye, because we're literally paying this customer to work there."" So, I mean, I can go on and on. I'm a big fan boy when it comes to Aspire.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Are there any specific instances that you can remember where you were like, ""Oh, this is amazing to know this particular metric or on this account""? Can you be a little more specific or tell us a story about some of those situations?
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it ties back to job costing, because I mean, that's such a crucial aspect of it. But, we also work with the [Haring Group 00:20:17], so they're obviously big fans of Aspire and they help us break all of that down. And we look at all the reports bimonthly and we go into detail, high level into it. And so, my gosh! I mean, looking at certain metrics like retention, growth, billable versus non-billable, down to which crew leaders most effective, which is not. I mean, the level of detail and where you're struggling, where you're doing well, and it's incredible. I mean, I don't see how you can run a business, at least, on anything, in my opinion, over two million maybe, if you don't have a system like that. It's a waste.
I mean, it's so easy to just spin your wheels, because I've done that. I've done that for so long where I spun my wheels and I'm like, ""What the hell am I doing wrong?"" And now, it's like, ""We know what we're doing and it's just doing it."" And I don't know. I know I'm probably not giving you specific what you're asking, but I mean, I've been really proud of our growth. We've been growing at crazy rate. I mean, you saw what I put in one of the questions, and I get asked all the time, ""How are you ...?"" Usually, you can't stay profitable when you grow at that rate, and we've been able to do that incredibly profitably, well over 20%.
Abby Hart
 Wow! That's incredible. I'm very impressed.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. I mean, I'm not trying to toot my own horn here, but the Haring Group, they tell us, ""We use you guys as a success story with our clients."" I'll be honest, some of that comes with the fact that we've really figured out our snow and ice game, so we're pretty darn good at that. We do really well with snow and ice. And so, when you take that division out, you look at the green business, we're still very much in the mid to high teens. Snow and ice just makes us one of the most profitable companies around for sure. It's crazy. And just today, a big national player reached out to me on LinkedIn who want to have coffee with me. And I'm like, ""It's crazy. It's surreal."" I never thought I'd have the attention of an actual national CEO. It was definitely humbling. I was like, ""Wow! This is weird.""
Abby Hart
 That's great. We may have to have a follow up conversation about snow and ice specifically, because that tends to be an area where people tend to struggle, especially depending on just the fickleness of the season and how to manage subcontractors and all of that.
Niwar Nasim
 It has been instrumental to our business. I'm happy to have further conversations about that. I'm proud to say we're really good at it.
Abby Hart
 That's great. So, you mentioned well over 20%. What's been your average net profit over the last few years?
Niwar Nasim
 Over the last three plus years, actually, 21,7 or something like that is the average. And that's working with the Haring Group the last two years. I see compiling all of our data. It's what's allowed us to grow at the rate that we're buying the new trucks and being able to attract these respected middle managers that I've been able to attract from these large companies in the area to be able to give them the salaries that they want and trust in that they're going to be able to deliver and execute. Everything you make you invest back into the business. And it's made dividends for us, for sure, I mean, absolutely.
Abby Hart
 Amazing. Great. So, I'll ask about implementation in a minute. What are the top three benefits, or, I mean, if you want to get feature specific, we can do that, but the top three benefits that you get from Aspire, Niwar?
Niwar Nasim
 Great question. Top three benefits of using Aspire, the all in one. I know there's a word for that. I always struggle with this. English is my second language, believe it or not.
Abby Hart
 I had no idea.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. It is. So, a lot of the times I do think in my native tongue before I have to convert it in my head, what I'm trying to say. The all in one. So, I'm struggling to find what the word is, and I've heard it so much, but it's the ...
Abby Hart
 Centralized?
Niwar Nasim
 Yes. Thank you. It's the centralized aspect of it where I don't have to ... So, that is one of my favorite. So, you said the question was my three favorite features. Was that what the question was? I got side tracked.
Abby Hart
 Top three benefits, or if you want to talk about features, we can talk about features. But, I'd say the top three things if someone were to ask you, ""What do you love best about using Aspire?""
Niwar Nasim
 
Speaker 1
 
Abby Hart
 Awesome. So, you started to type a story or instance of how Aspire has changed your business for the better. I believe we may have asked you a similar question when we interviewed you for the testimonials, but was there ever like a champagne moment where you're like, ""Ah!"" I'm sure people may have referred to it as a ""Wow!"" moment or what have you, but what was the real revolutionary thing where you're like, ""We've never been able to do this before. This [inaudible 00:29:48]""?
Niwar Nasim
 Absolutely. Right.
Abby Hart
 Can you tell me a story about that?
Niwar Nasim
 For sure. And a lot of credit to the Haring Group, because they've helped me [inaudible 00:30:05]. It's one thing to implement Aspire and start using it. And it's another thing to start getting reports and understanding what the reports actually mean. So, I mean, I never had CFO level type training, so that's why we work with people like that so they can educate us and whatnot. So, that ""Aha!"" moment, when we started actually getting enough data and started looking at our properties, we do a ton of commercial maintenance, and when I was able to finally see where we were profitable and where we were not. And I remember we had this one large property where it was a highly coveted property, and we were doing it for a while.
And I could tell you, everybody wanted this property and it was always a thing. And this customer, it almost felt like they had leverage because they were the high profile property. And I touched on this actually in the previous answers, but when we found out that we were doing it at a 31% gross margin, to me, it was like, ""Oh, my gosh! Where was this software when we first got on board with this place?"" It was like, ""Damn! How do you run a company without this level of technology?"" It was incredible. And again, here we are, we're thinking we've got this highly coveted property and it's incredible. And guess what? We actually still do that property, and we now do it at a fair margin, because I was able to literally take reports, show them what we've done, and why where we are [inaudible 00:31:45].
And it took some tough conversations, but we had a customer that really liked us. And I had to take reports and data from what we got from Aspire, and with help of the Haring Group, I had to sit down in front of a board, but we got a very healthy increase with this property. And now, it continues to be one of our best properties, but it's done profitably. So, that's a success story as well as a ""Aha!"" moment. But, when I saw that report, because they literally will rank your most profitable down to your absolute ... They call them the losers. And that was my ""Aha!"" moment. I have many other ones, but when I saw that, I'm like, ""Oh, my gosh!"" Because it exposes everything. It exposes how you bid, where you're strong at, where you thought you were strong at and you weren't and all of that. So, that immediately jumps into my mind. I [inaudible 00:32:42] so many other ones, but ...
Abby Hart
 That's great. What were you expecting to operate at with that client?
Niwar Nasim
 I mean, gosh! At least 45. Gosh! I mean, we shoot for 50% gross margin on commercial maintenance. When you get into the large properties, you could do it for lower of course, but we don't want to have work just to do work. And that's the problem with our industry is there's a lot of people that do a lot of work, but they just do work to do work and they don't make money. And it's like, ""Man, what we do is hard work. It's really hard work."" And a lot of that is just you don't know what you don't know, and that's the sad part. I've seen people spend literally their whole careers and they're doing the same thing over and over.
And I'm like, ""Man, if this person only knew ..."" And I go out of my way to help my peers if I can, but some people are just so set in their ways or maybe just afraid, because it's something new. I'll be honest, I was terrified when I went through implementation, terrified. Maybe that's one of the questions that'll come up, but I did not have a good experience with my implementation. It's a well known story with some of the higher ups at Aspire. I've more than complained, but I've been authentic about my experience and very real about it and whatnot. Some, of it has been our own fault and happy to talk about that.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. Well, that was actually my next question. What was the implementation process like? Were there any major road bumps? What about ongoing training?
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. Thanks for the question. I mean, look, the reality was, and it sounds like you haven't heard my story, but I did not have a good implementation. And I had the best implementation manager in my opinion. I didn't know what others were like, but [Stephanie Ryder 00:34:46], absolutely incredible. The problem was we were a company that never really had actual data. Our data was all over the damn place. And had I known the Haring Group existed before, or maybe a third party type of a person that knew Aspire, I would've hired them to help me with implementation. Aspire did everything they did. They told me, ""Look, you need to take this super seriously. This is a serious commitment, because it's all about implementation. You got to get this thing done right and whatnot.""
And we're going through our big growth spurt now. We're in the very thick of it all. And so, I'm trying to run a business, do bids, very much run our ... I was running our construction crews at the time and also be an implementation guy. And I'm staying up late hours into night. About a month into it with Stephanie during our implementation, we got to the part about doing the money back. And she's asking me, ""Well, we need to get your data on here."" And I literally looked at it and I'm like, ""I don't know what the hell this is. I don't know what to do."" She was like, ""Well, what do you mean? You have to because you've got to.""
I literally have no clue. I'm like, ""I don't want to just throw numbers into this thing, because this dictates and sets the way how everything else is done."" So, we stopped. Our implementation literally paused. And she got [John Gole 00:36:30] involved, and I had some conversations with him and he ended up hooking me up with the Haring Group. We hired them, literally spent a month with them and gave them all of our crappy all over the place financial crap. I mean, it was just stuff that I would give to my CPA in a box, anything I could figure out, everything, and said, ""Hey, here you go.""
And that's their area. And they figured out what's our overhead, what we need to be charging, where we're at, what are our expenses. All of that stuff, they put it all together for us. And the Haring Group is actually able to get into our money packet. They helped us set that part up. And then, after that, because implementation, they give you a three month window or whatever. Well, we paused for a month. So, guess what? Now we're a month behind. So, do you know what the next two months were like? They were rushed and I had a horrible time, because I'm a slow learner, I like to take my time. And Stephanie did everything she possibly and personally could to help me.
But, the reality was she had others that she had to get to and I'm just screaming and begging for help like ""Help me, help me, help me."" And it sucked. I mean, it was just terrible. And I complained [inaudible 00:38:07] and I cried. Not literally, but I did all of that. And I was frustrated. Then they told me, ""Go watch videos,"" or ""I'll set you up with so and so."" And I'd talk to so and so, and they'd say, ""Oh, yeah. That's somebody else's area."" And I'm like, ""We're trying to run a business. I need the answers now. I have a question that literally will take 10 seconds to answer and I have to set up an appointment with someone."" If you have to ask me a question about what my biggest frustration with Aspire is, in my opinion, the lack of support when it comes to stuff like that. And they have the questions where you've got to submit, but that's not exactly ... Just having somebody that can answer the [inaudible 00:38:49].
I know that's probably unrealistic these days, but that's probably the biggest thing, because sometimes you have a question and it's just being able to ask it and get an answer in a minute. It would be awesome, but I also understand it's an enterprise level software and you guys have gone through incredible growth, which is a testament. And I get that too. So, I mean, at the end of the day, it is what it is. This is what was meant to happen. And we went through this the way it was supposed to be. I believe in everything happens for a reason.
And if I could also maybe share some input, I would say this, just like how John Gole referred the Haring Group to us, and I'm sure he probably does to others that he thinks could help them, I would suggest that, I don't know whose role that would be, but utilize people [inaudible 00:39:48] advisors and others that are [inaudible 00:39:51] consulting companies that are out there. I wish they would've told me like, ""Hey, you need extra help. It's going to cost you more, but if you really want to spend the money, these guys can help you. They seem to know their stuff."" I didn't know about these people. And had they told me that, then I would've honestly signed up with them last Summer.
I just signed up with Two Twelve Advisors two months ago and they've helped us so much and get so much more out of the software than we could've ever had or done on our own, because we're not at that point where we have our own chief technology officer or our own Aspire specialist. And so, I mean, that's what I would do if I'm an Aspirer. I would have my trusted partners and say, ""Hey, while we do have all the resources you could need, you have your own dedicated CSN person that you meet with once a month, and mine's [Peggy Hughes [00:40:51], love her. She's awesome.""
Abby Hart
 She's awesome.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. She really is. But, some of us, I mean, I'll just say myself, I'm a slow learner and I have to bring on people, middle managers, that have never seen anything like Aspire. And I don't even know that much about Aspire, and now I have to teach these people how to get acquainted with Aspire. And it's like, ""What am I supposed to do? Tell them to go watch videos or read these manuals? I know I'm going on a little ramble here, but it's more of just my personal feedback. Again, I know it's not feasible for everybody to use these third party consulting companies, but man, I mean, it was instrumental for us because we now are able to use other parts of Aspire that are helping us.
And frankly, we just couldn't get that time to set those things up with someone like Peggy or myself even, because I'm running the day to day stuff and I don't have time to sit there and watch videos and put email requests in and stuff like that. So, I don't know. That's just a very raw and organic feeling that I have towards my experience on that front.
Abby Hart
 I've got you. This is all great feedback. And just for clarification, you hired the Haring Group to set you up with the information that you needed to finish out or execute your implementation?
Niwar Nasim
 Correct.
Abby Hart
 And now you're using Two Twelve as your ongoing training advisors. Is that accurate, Niwar?
Niwar Nasim
 That is correct, yes. And we also still use the Haring group, so I use both companies. Haring Group is specifically financial CFO level type consulting, where the Two Twelve Advisors, and they're local, of course, they're actually in our state in Puyallup, they help us more with processes and SOPs and stuff in this software, which has been so cool, because I have a lot of new middle managers over the last six to eight months. And again, so many of them don't know what Aspire is. And I'm not a trainer. I still need to learn myself. And so, having people like that, literally we can call them and we have their cell phones, they answer. And that's amazing. I mean, there's a cost component to it, of course.
It's not cheap, it's expensive, but I mean, we see the dividends right away. It's amazing. I mean, I brought a new area manager on and I was freaking the hell out because I was like, ""I don't even know how to do scheduling lists."" The scheduling side, I wasn't strong in Aspire. And I got them hooked up with the Two Twelve advisors, and literally within a week he just took it on and on his own. And he was like, ""Yeah, dude. I couldn't have done this just watching videos. This is great. These people are literally holding your hand."" So, anyway, just feedback.
Abby Hart
 That's all great to know. And I'm so glad that the Two Twelve has helped you guys out as well. Both the Haring Group and Two Twelve are great partners. There's a number of other consults we work with as well and that's something that we're trying to talk more and inform prospects and current clients about the availability of our partners like that, that can help get the most out of the software.
Niwar Nasim
 I love that you said that. That's huge. I mean, obviously you guys are going to let folks know there's a cost component to this. We have all the resources too, but if you need more, just letting them know of the options. I was never made aware of that option and that was probably the most frustrating thing for me. And it's okay. I mean, I'm not bitter about it. I would've picked up so much more and it would've been a lot more easier. So, that's great. I'm glad to hear that.
Abby Hart
 Great. Do you have five more minutes, Niwar? Do you need to get somewhere? Okay, great. Ben, do you have any follow up questions on anything before I [inaudible 00:45:23]?
Ben Sanders
 I was just curious. We've indirectly touched on it and I'm just curious from your perspective in the marketplace right now in general with what you're doing, where do you rank getting and retaining personnel and staff in comparison to [inaudible 00:45:42]?
Abby Hart
 I was just going to ask that.
Ben Sanders
 Okay. I didn't know. Sorry.
Abby Hart
 No. Not your fault.
Ben Sanders
 I'm trying to get a feel for the marketplace, because I know these things change over time and some things become more pressing and stuff. But, I'm just curious with what you see at this point in time. How do you rank the personnel and retaining people as compared to the other market challenges that you face? Do you rank it as number two, number three, the top problem, or where do you see yourself at? Where do you see that at right now?
Niwar Nasim
 I would agree with what you just said right there. Number two, three, honestly. I wouldn't really say it's the number one. Right now, finding a qualified or competent irrigation technicians, I would honestly put it at number one. They are next to impossible to find. But, to your question, I would say two, three, four, sure. Absolutely. Very much high up there on the list. Very much so. I mean, do you want me to expand on that a little bit too?
Ben Sanders
 Yeah. Then maybe what are one or two of the problems that you're facing in the marketplace just in general? And it could be broad strokes, but I'm just curious if personnel isn't top right now, what's one or two of the other really, I don't know, just problems that you face.
Niwar Nasim
 So, I mean, that example of the irrigation tech, I mean, that would be personnel, right? So, it very much is one, two. But, maybe one or two more, it might be a cliche answer, but it ties into the personnel thing too though. And it's disappointing too, because it's these bigger companies. I'll just say it. I'll just rip the band aid off, like BrightView, and I'm talking these regional guys. The ethical standards, it seems to maybe vary between different regions or branches. I mean, we have literally managers that will come on our job sites and hand out business cards to our people on our job sites. I don't know. I mean, it's a new thing for me. I didn't see that the first eight years, but this last three years, it's becoming a lot more common and I'm just like ... So, you start to see that level of desperation out there. You're like, ""Man, it's a real crunch right now. Everybody is really hurting.""
And so, that's one thing that I don't worry about it, because at the end of the day, I've always been in this belief if somebody's not happy and we, myself, our company can't keep them happy, then we're just not a good fit for them. And so, we can only control what we can control, and that's to give them a good environment, respect, make sure they're well paid and all of that, and make sure the recipe's there. And if ultimately that's still not good enough, then it just wasn't meant to be and it's time to move on. And so, another one, man, it comes down to education. It probably goes back to the irrigation area where we have so many needs in our industry and such high level opportunity, high paying level opportunities, where I don't know what it is, man, but we lack serious education when it comes to certain positions that you need, like irrigation technician. You can't find them anymore.
They're like a dying breed or something. Especially for myself, I keep emphasizing this because we are very much a player right now with the BrightViews here, at least in our region. We've been on the same stuff all the time, large portfolio type properties, and you need qualified technicians on these properties. And if you don't, you're going to just lose your butt on these things. And I don't know. You get people that throw, I mean, I'm talking 35, $40 an hour at guys that all they know is how to swap heads and fix a broken pipe. It's scary like, ""Where are these guys, man?"" And I don't know. I don't know if I answered your question in a way that satisfied what you're asking me, but it's more of a frustration as well.
Ben Sanders
 No. That's really helpful. And I would even just be transparent with you. I mean, I'm hearing about attracting good people and keeping some of these highly qualified specialists. And Aspire tends to focus on the business side and operations. And I'm just continually curious about if there're ever opportunities where anything that Aspire currently does could reach in and help with retention or finding people, which is a [inaudible 00:51:03]. I realize that. And you mentioned that even just one observation was, with those middle managers, how, when you got transparent with them about the data, it was attractive to them and helped them and they were bought into your business faster, which does touch on that question. But, I was just curious if [inaudible 00:51:23] any other ways that you thought creatively about using the software or just out there to either find these people or keep them.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. That's a great question. So, I could say I'm not sure from a labor standpoint. I mean, I suppose you could talk to them about how cool an app is, but I mean, at the end of day, I don't think they give a damn to be honest. That's my raw answer.
Ben Sanders
 Totally.
Niwar Nasim
 But, I'm glad you clarified that up a little bit. And I apologize because sometimes I'll probably go on a ramble there or whatever. But, my area manager right now, I was able to attract him from another smaller company, but they're a respected company in the area. He managed eight to 10 maintenance crews. He was never able to see how he did, if they were profitable. It was always kept away from him. And this guy is as loyal as you can get. I knew the guy for [inaudible 00:52:29] before he even worked at that company. I finally reached out to him one day and I said, ""Hey, [Adam 00:52:35]. Do you want to meet for ...?"" We did and I told him about Aspire. And I'm not joking when I say this, when I pulled up my laptop and I showed him our properties and what we were doing and what somebody in an AM role had in terms of tools at their fingertips, it literally sold him. And he ended up putting his two weeks in. I met him on a Sunday. He met with the owners of the company the very next day.
He put his two weeks in. One of the partners of that company called me direct. And hear me out here. And I remember this so well, and this was back this past February, so this is not that long ago. And he said, ""What's going on here? I had a ton of respect for you guys and all of a sudden my number one guy comes up to me and he just drops this thing on us right before our season starts. You guys have been plotting this thing for months."" And I swear to you, I sat there and I said ... Well, I just sat there and said, ""Look, I can't tell you, but all I did was this."" And just like I told you, I told him that. And it was the information that this poor guy had been seeking for a long time. It was stunting his growth. He was literally stuck. He was doing the same thing. And we're talking about a college grad here, so not a [inaudible 00:54:09].
Ben Sanders
 Not senior or older.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. A smart, intelligent college guy, but was very much in a rut, loyal, but screaming and asking for information and help like ""How can I do more? What can I do to get better?"" And I'm like, ""Man."" And literally, I pulled up the laptop and I told him, ""Look, this is what we do."" And some of our properties he knew about because they used to do them at their company. And I'm like, ""Yeah. This is what this crew leader does it at. Here's how we perform in the Spring,"" and showed him all these things.
And he was like, ""Holy cow!"" I mean, he lit up. And it was sad because it was like, ""Man, this person has been held back."" So, to your question, I don't know if every potential middle manager is going to have that reaction, but that was big. The irrigation technician is another one. My irrigation manager now, I actually promoted him from the field. He came from BrightView, and BrightView obviously has their own systems and whatnot, but same thing though. I was able to show him, and of course there's that, you probably have heard of this, I don't know if you guys do a ton of irrigation or not, but the whole partnership with Weathermatic with Aspire. I don't know if you know much about that.
There's an integration aspect with Weathermatic and Aspire. And I actually flew [Louise 00:55:42] and one of my enhancement managers down to Texas. It was back in February. And I mean, you want to talk about a guy who just, again, lit up like a Christmas tree. We're talking about a guy who has always been a tech, younger guy, but never really was given an opportunity to grow and just stuck in a position in the trenches and digging. And we flat out gave an opportunity to get into a management role and started showing him some of these tools and how he could literally have an iPad in his hands, be on the Weathermatic app, do an evaluation, how that information literally in five minutes can be dumped into Aspire, and he can send out his proposals in the field.
I mean, we're talking about stuff that is revolutionary for our industry for somebody like that, where in the past, he'd have to have a notepad and bring those notes back to the office and have somebody type up those things. And now, he's able to do 30 evaluations in a day where before it was seven or eight. And so, that's huge for him because he's able to do more volume and you're teaching him software and you're now investing in your people and teaching them real life skills, real software that helps their confidence and helps the bottom line of the company. I could go on and on. And so, those are two good examples where we took the software itself and the irrigation went with the integration aspect, and these two guys were like, ""Holy cow! This is unlike anything I've ever done before. This is incredible. This is it.""
And I don't know. I'm trying to think if there're any other ones like that. I'll put it this way, two of my other managers came from a regional company and they were using some other internal software program. And I remember one of the managers, a really highly respected guy, who's actually my construction manager now, he said their program was called IFS. He's like, ""IFS is what ..."" No. He said, ""Aspire is what IFS wants to be."" We're talking about a hundred plus million dollar company, branches all over the West Coast and them spending millions and millions of dollars on this cumbersome platform, when they could literally jump on board, like LandCare has. And LandCare is a big national company and they're Aspire customer.
And so, it was interesting hearing that feedback from them, because they came from another well respected regional company, but they were like, ""Man, this is great. You don't have to do this, where with some other software I had to do this."" And we're talking about really senior level estimators that have been in the industry a long time. And you teach them things and show them tools that frankly they've never had before. And you can demonstrate that to them like, ""This is what you can do. This is how long instead of spending ..."" So, we do a lot of big commercial installs, half million plus. And if you've got your kits ready and if you've got your estimate templates ready, instead of spending three days on a proposal, three hours, if you've got everything set up correctly. I mean, that's huge, right?
Ben Sanders
 Yeah. That's massive.
Niwar Nasim
 That's incredible. So, for me, that's what I've done is when I meet with a potential key hire, I just show [inaudible 00:59:34].
Ben Sanders
 You'll bring that.
Niwar Nasim
 I do. I open it up.
Ben Sanders
 Do you pop open a laptop or a tablet, or what do you use?
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. A laptop usually, just because it's just easier for me. And I just open it up, man. I show them what they want to see, let them ask me questions. We go through scenarios even. We build a proposal. That's actually how I was able to convince my area manager when I was able to. And then, of course the scheduling, him being able to see his properties, how they were performing.
Ben Sanders
 So, you actually just used a feature in the meeting just to do a quick demo just to make your point?
Niwar Nasim
 Yes, absolutely. With [Tim 01:00:21], my construction manager, I actually put it on a big 75 inch monitor, and we were doing role playing. I mean, we were going through a big bid I was doing at the time and I was showing him. And man, we're talking about a guy who's been in the industry for 40 plus years. His jaw dropped. He's like, ""Whoa! Where the hell was this, I mean, all these years?"" I was like, ""Well, I don't know, man, but you can do that here.""
And I'm not kidding. It was a big deal as to how I was able to attract these people. And that's the big thing what the Haring Group always preaches like embracing and integrating and adopting enterprise level software. I mean, you'll hear those phrases out of [Greg's 01:01:12] mouth all the time. And when you do that and you are able to show that to potential key personnel, if it's the right person, the message, it'll be heard loud and clear. There's a huge gap right now in a lot of the companies that are large that don't have this and it's frustrating, because we all want to make our jobs easier. Everybody wants automation.
So, that's been my recipe, man, and literally showing them a laptop or bring it into my office and we pull it up on the big monitor and we watch things and show them reports and this is what you're going to have when you're a production guy, this is what you're going to have when you're an AM, this is what you're going to have when you're a construction manager. It's real because I'm not just a sales guy, I'm a real life customer and you're looking at my real life data. This is what it is. This is what you're getting. And of course, I was like, ""Look, you're going to have support here. You're going to have myself, you're going to have Two Twelve Advisors. You have a plethora of videos."" So, you start talking about all the ... Because it can also come off a little intimidating to somebody whose never [inaudible 01:02:29].
Ben Sanders
 A little overwhelming.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah, for sure. But, for me, I've been able to show and demonstrate like, ""You're not going to be left alone here. You're going to have a lot of resources here. The people at Aspire are amazing. You've got our Two Twelve Advisors."" As Abby mentioned, there's a bunch of other ones as well. There're resources out there that are available, because the software, [inaudible 01:02:58]. I remember I attended my first conference there last year in Columbus. And sitting in some of those seminars, there were several companies there that mentioned they'd been on the software for five, six years, and every day, every week they're learning new things
So, you can never know all of it. You're always building on it. And it was nice to hear that, because it was like, ""Okay."" [inaudible 01:03:22] an impatient person. I was like, ""I've got to know all the stuff now. I need to know now."" But, it doesn't work that way, because it just takes time and you've just got to be patient. It just takes time and it does come together. It does click it. It really does work, man. And I don't know. Big fan. I would never do this again without it, ever. It would be a complete waste of time.
Ben Sanders
 That was very helpful. That was very interesting. Thanks for sharing a couple of those stories. It's [inaudible 01:03:56].
Niwar Nasim
 You bet. And I'm sorry that it took a little while before I finally got to your question, because again, that's where my English as a second language comes in sometimes, man. I struggle there at times.
Ben Sanders
 No. It's no problem at all.
Niwar Nasim
 Thank you.
Abby Hart
 That was wildly informative. Thank you.
Niwar Nasim
 Thank you.
Abby Hart
 I mean, I don't think I have any other follow up questions. You've mentioned some specific metrics in here. If you think of any other ones, Niwar, if you could send them our way, but your client retention is at 98%. [inaudible 01:04:34].
Niwar Nasim
 98%. Absolutely. We're super proud of that. I'll be honest too, in our region, up in the Northwest right now, there's something crazy going on. I don't know what the heck is going on, but it definitely plays into our favor. There's a lot of attrition going on and a lot of movement with some of the VCs coming in and buying up these companies. And BrightView is struggling, and so it's played into our favor. We've been able to get a lot of their sites and some of these key middle managers. I don't know how long that'll last, but it's crazy. We're in a very unstable market right now, which is playing really into our favor. So, no complaints.
Abby Hart
 Interesting.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah, it is.
Abby Hart
 Do you have any idea why people are moving from the big guys like BrightView or maybe LandCare?
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. I love that you asked that question because it does tie to what we were just talking about before with people coming on board. I hear this all the time, ""I'm tired of the corporate crap. I'm tired of the corporate whatever adjective you want to describe us."" I've been getting a lot of that. So, what people have been able to share with us is that we run our company like a corporate company, but we're very much a family private ... So, it's a different atmosphere, right? So, from our trucks to our, not to use Greg's words, but our enterprise level softwares and whatnot, it's great for them because that's what they're used to.
They want good equipment. They want software that actually works. It's not too cumbersome. But again, this is not a corporate level deal. So, I run our company very much. I aspire to be like a LandCare. And I don't have a vision to be that big, but I mean, we're talking two, three branches in a few years, a realistic shot at that. You have to operate at that mindset. And so, that appeals to a lot of these people that have been at the largest companies and they've been burnt out, they've gotten tired of it, but they don't necessarily want to just either ... Well, I had a guy actually that worked at a really large company. He's our enhancement manager now. He actually thought about just getting out of the industry altogether and go back to school to be a teacher.
I don't know why, but it was just a thought of his. And he came on board with us, and he just told me after his three month evaluation the other day that he's never been as happy in his role in the industry since he's joined us. And that was incredible to hear because it was a change that he needed and he'd been burnt out. Younger guy, in his early 40s, but very much burned out. And so, it was that corporate thing for him that really just drained him. And he's still able to conduct business the way he does with his clients. And he's a certified [Arbisal 01:08:02], got all of their certifications in the world and stuff. So, he's a professional and he wants to still work like a professional. But, the environment for him, it wore on him. And so, I've heard that feedback from several of our staff who've come from the largest companies, and it's pretty cool to hear that because it's like they acknowledge that we're not the small guy, but we don't want to be like the BrightView of the world. Do you know what I mean?
Ben Sanders
 Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Niwar Nasim
 It's a sweet spot, in a way.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. Do you have any metrics on your employee retention over the last few years since you've been using this?
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. Good question. And I wish I could say. And I almost want to make up a number, but it's been great actually. I don't have an actual number though. But, it's been great. Let's put it this way, we've been able to shed the not so great people that you outgrow, for lack of a better way of putting it. But, I'll put it this way, the people that we do bring on, they stay with us. They don't leave. I don't have an actual metric. This is one area that I , as a professional, need to get better at is looking more at the numbers. I'm not quite there where I look at my dials every day. I need to do a better job of that. It this is where my organic authentic side comes out is where I'm not good at, I'll tell you. I need to do a better job at knowing certain numbers. And I rely maybe a little too much on the Haring Group to break things down for me, because I feel like I'm not as smart as them.
Abby Hart
 I mean, if it's working, it's working. It sounds like this, so phenomenal. Well, thank you so much, Niwar. Do you have anything else, Ben?
Ben Sanders
 No, I don't give. Give him back his time.
Abby Hart
 Yes please. I mean, we just took an extra half hour, but this was [inaudible 01:09:57].
Niwar Nasim
 That's okay. I enjoy this. I love to share what works for us. I do that here. Just a couple of last thoughts, I say this everywhere I go, at least here in the Puget Sound area, Ben, you're familiar, but in the industry here, we have a very closed minded, very sheltered ... I don't know what the heck it is man. But people, at least in here, this region, they're very sheltered. They're close-minded. I don't know. They're nervous. They don't share information. They don't talk about what works for them. And I don't find that to be the case when I go to the Midwest and I go to the East Coast. People are way more open. They're like, ""Everybody wants to help each other."" And I'm like, ""What the hell is going on up in Seattle? Is it the rain?""
I mean, I don't know. So, I just wish our industry up here was just more open-minded, was willing to share more, not be so insecure. I don't know. So, that's why I enjoy this, because if I can help someone else that is going through what I was going through and it helps them, that's incredible for me. To me, that's more fulfilling than buying a brand new truck or landing a large account, seriously, like watching people develop and get better. And that's literally the number one thing I enjoy out of this is developing my staff, taking a guy who was a tech and in the trenches, and now he's blossoming as an irrigation manager, like one of my greatest accomplishments.
Abby Hart
 I'm sorry. I had one last question, Niwar. You mentioned that you use Go iLawn.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. I use Go iLawn dating back to 2012, 2013, way back in the day.
Abby Hart
 So, I mean, this is actually new to me, how the Go iLawn and Aspire piece are working together currently. Can you talk a little bit? I mean, you don't need to go into depth, but I'm just curious how it's working now, and what your hopes are for the integration in the future.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah, for sure. So, I'm familiar with it, but I haven't actually been using it as much, just because I don't do estimating and [inaudible 01:12:18] I used to. But, because I was using Go iLawn so much, I'm obviously very familiar with that doing takeoffs and measurements. To put it simply, it's like Google Earth. You do all of your measurements and you save the different areas, parking lot, lawn, beds, whatever, and you save the different work groups. And just like the Weathermatic integration, there's a feature where you can import or export, I forget, into Aspire. And all of that data, instead of writing down the scratch pad or something like that, and that imagery, the high resolution imagery, you can dump that into Aspire.
And they've got it integrated it now. So, all of that legwork of putting all of that data in, as long as it's set up correctly, it goes straight into those work areas. So now, your estimates opportunities that you're creating, instead of, I don't know. I mean, depending on the job, if it's a half hour deal, it literally can be a five minute deal, because all the data's in. You're now just tweaking some things and maybe adding some verbiage, making sure your gross margins are where they need to be. And that's it. I mean, it's automation and that's what the world is going towards is automating everything. And these tools are there, just like the weather matter one. I mean, at the conference, we had a guy there, it was a Texas company, I forget the name, but they used this.
And instead of their technician spending time out there going and activating systems and writing stuff on their note, they have iPads and they're sending proposals from the field getting approvals, sometimes getting it instant and they're on the site, they're doing jobs. Everything's now being automated. And so, Aspire's ability with Go iLawn, Weathermatic ... I want to say there's another one. Isn't it Land Off? I want to say.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. LandOne Takeoff.
Niwar Nasim
 Right. I'm not familiar with that one, but very much similar to that. I mean, those are crucial for people that want to save time, and they pay for themselves in folds. So, all about that, all about integration. That's talking about other benefits of Aspire, it's the integration. Our fleet, we have 27 trucks, and it's all on FleetSharp and it integrates with Aspire. That integration right there, IPS, our payroll processing system, integrates with Aspire. So, you talked about programs that all sync with one another, and again, to use Greg's words, the enterprise level software. All of that together, it's awesome because it's connected, and it just makes things easy. The technology is there, you just have to embrace it and plunge, go for it.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. Thank you so much, Niwar. I really appreciate your time. You've given us so much to think about and write about. I'm going to be reaching out to you for your headshot. And if you have any personal photos of your crews and trucks, that would be phenomenal. Do you have any? I mean, this is probably a hard ask, but if you have any that happen to have the Aspire software in use, that would be cool, like somebody with a tablet.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. You're talking about photos of myself or our staff using Aspire or something like that?
Abby Hart
 Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 That'd great.
Niwar Nasim
 So, we're going through a huge rebrand right now. Our name is even changing to Nasim Landscape. So, we're dropping the ""And Sons."" So, maybe take note of that. So, it's just going to be called Nasim Landscape. And complete revamp over the website. I mean, it's long overdue, but I mean, I can get you some photographs and stuff like that. But, we're very much in a big rebrand phase. Probably take a few months for it to be all done, but excited for that because our current web is just not indicative of what we are now. So, it's been a project that's been in the works for a while and we're excited about that. But, I'll definitely get you that information. Do you have a deadline on that or anything like that?
Abby Hart
 If you could get it to me by the end of the week, that would be great.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah, absolutely. I'll do the best I can to do that. Not a problem.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. Well, Monday might be fine because I feel like ...
Niwar Nasim
 Okay.
Abby Hart
 Because then, I can get you a draft when you're sending me some photos. So, that would work.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah, absolutely. And if you get some contacts [inaudible 01:17:41] Landscape Management still, I would love to be feeling that as well, because I've always been like, ""How cool [inaudible 01:17:46] one day to share my story?"" Because I'm like [inaudible 01:17:48].
Abby Hart
 I will absolutely pass it on.
Niwar Nasim
 Well, I appreciate that, just because we literally ran from Saddam Hussein. I mean, we came here with nothing and it's crazy. I reflect back. I'm like, ""I want to share my story one day, man."" And I say that in a humble way to just show that you put your mind to something and you work hard, anything is possible. And I know that sounds super cheesy to say, but it's so true. I mean, this country is all about opportunities and it's just an incredible blessing to be living in America.
Abby Hart
 I mean, this is a great industry you've chosen, Niwar. And I mean, we're happy to have you as a client. This has been great.
Niwar Nasim
 Thank you.
Ben Sanders
 Thank you. Have a wonderful afternoon.
Niwar Nasim
 Yeah. Nice talking to you guys. I really enjoyed my time.
Ben Sanders
 Yeah. Take care.
Abby Hart
 Take care, Niwar. We'll be in touch.
Niwar Nasim
 Okay. Take care. Bye for now."

 ... capture what you just said. So when I said that you guys had, had a positive experience you said that it was that onboarding with [inaudible 00:00:14].
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. Getting Aspire, running our operations through Aspire is probably one of the best, if not the best business decisions that Pleasant Places has made in 40 years of existence.
Abby Hart
 Wow. What about it has been so game changing for your team?
Gilly Artigues
 Well, number one, the visibility in real time. Prior to Aspire, we were sort of running... So I like to say that we were sort of in the stone age before we switched over we would do schedules. It was literally a piece of paper, like a little template piece of paper where guys would take a pen and write where they went, how long they were there, what they did, et cetera, those would be reviewed manually. You would make notes for what is billable work, what's not. That would then go to the payroll people who take the hours, put it in. Then it would go to accounts receivable where anything that was marked billable on that schedule was billed and of course that opens up a bunch of other questions because I mean just...
Okay. And I'm telling you stuff you already know, but with Aspire, you go, you do an estimate. Everybody works off of that estimate that opportunity and then it seamlessly flows to accounts receivable. There's no question. Well, who actually gets the bill, what do I put on the invoice etcetera. So scheduling was a joke in my opinion and now we've obviously rectified that. The estimating, we didn't really have any real estimating software. We had spreadsheets and things like that but Aspire builds in profit margin and you can create these kits and it's just very, very easy to get an estimate out quickly and be confident in the margins that you're pricing work. Let's see, what else? Purchasing, goodness gracious. Purchasing is a lot better and it goes back to the estimating and the visibility.
Before we had Aspire we were estimating we had like a budget for the job, but each line item on the estimate wasn't necessary. It didn't necessarily have its own budget. And again, going back into visibility, we would get done with the job and then we'd say, ""Okay, how'd we do?"" And with aspire, what you can do and what has made a huge difference for us, on the occasion that a job maybe isn't hitting the goals that you want it to, or you're exceeding your budgeted hours or material budget or whatever you can see that happening in real time and make the adjustments when the job is 30% complete, as opposed to if a 100% complete and now we're saying, okay, we need to adjust our pricing on X, Y, and Z, or do better the next time or whatever. So the best part to me and it's sort of encompasses 90% of the workflow process is again the visibility by everyone and the ability to see data and information in real time. That's the biggest thing for us at Pleasant Places.
Abby Hart
 That's phenomenal. Thanks, Gilly. So there was so much there.
Gilly Artigues
 I talk a lot. So you can just tell me to be quiet when you [inaudible 00:05:26].
Abby Hart
 No, this is exactly what I'm looking for. This is fantastic. You said scheduling was in your words a joke. So what was scheduling like before?
Gilly Artigues
 So we would go-
Abby Hart
 Like what was the situation?
Gilly Artigues
 So what we would do as far as... Not time injury, you're asking about scheduling. So what we would do is we would have meetings two or three times a week Tuesday, Thursday, or every other day or something like that and we would literally say out loud what we're doing. There was no big board on the wall or anything that said starting this week and until the end of July this crew's going to be doing X, Y, and Z at this job it was like an ongoing... In my opinion as the president and getting Aspire was the first thing I did when I became president, but walking in and seeing that I said ""Well, from my perspective as the boss, I can't see past tomorrow or the next day.""
So it was a constantly... We had to meet about it a lot. That takes a lot of time and energy just to sit down and say, ""Okay, what we doing? What we doing today? Are we on task? What are we doing tomorrow? What we doing the next day? Okay, sounds good."" We'll meet on Thursday and I'll ask you the same questions. And when you do that it's tough for you to stick to budgeted man hours, because with Aspire, what we can do is we say, okay, five man crew, that's 40 hours a day. We have budgeted 400 hours for this job. Let's go ahead and schedule it out for the next 10 working days and we know we have to get done on or before that 10th day. So the way we were doing like I said, it wasn't effective. It was bad and our margins reflected that.
Abby Hart
 Can you tell me what... And I may or may not put this in, but you'll get a chance to review the article after I write it. Could you tell me like what your margins were pre Aspire and what they are post?
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. So our margins before aspire we were in the 28% range gross we shoot for 35. When I came in I was a VP for like four or five years and I did all the math and everything and said this is what we need to be successful and we were never able to get there. We were always off by five to 8%, something like that. And now our margins are above 40% gross. So it's a huge difference and we didn't hire anybody new. It's not people, the managers were ineffective or anything. We didn't find a magic supplier that had everything cheaper. We weren't able to just raise our prices by that much. There's no other explanation other than Aspire is working as we intended it to.
Abby Hart
 That's phenomenal. Wow. Okay, great. Above 40%. Fantastic. Okay. So let's see schedules, estimating, purchasing and just the visibility all the way through.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 Is really-
Gilly Artigues
 That's huge, such a big thing because we do... I guess last year we did a little over 20,000,000 and I think 2019, which was before Aspire I think we did about 22,000,000. 2020 was a rough year but 2021 we rebounded then this year we're probably going to do 22 or better again and we've got a lot of people that work here. There's probably close to 250 full-time people here.
Abby Hart
 Oh, wow.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. It's a lot to keep up with. It's a lot to keep up with on a spreadsheet or in the old [inaudible 00:11:08]. So you have to have something like this to take it to the next level. My dad started this company in 1984 and I told him when I came to start working here in a sort of an officer role I'm starting to look at the financials and looking at how we're doing things. And I said, ""Dad, this right here, the way you're the way we do things here is fine if you want to do seven, eight, $9,000,000 a year. I think we have the capacity to do that effectively and profitably with this infrastructure that we have here.""
But my dad has bigger aspirations than that. We want to get to 50,000,000 and then a 100,000,000. So we're aggressively trying to grow the business. And I said, ""Look, you just can't..."" And he's an old school guy started it from nothing all that stuff, but to get to that next level and to do it effectively we can't rely on pieces of loose leaf paper and spreadsheets and stuff like that. It's just not going to work. So Aspire really brought us into the 21st century. It's been a real blessing for us. It really has.
Abby Hart
 That's great, Gilly. So let's take a step back. So 2019 you said was pre Aspire right?
Gilly Artigues
 Yes.
Abby Hart
 When did you guys onboard?
Gilly Artigues
 I believe we probably started the process sometime late 2019, but I want to say February or March of 2020 was probably, we're officially on Aspire.
Abby Hart
 Okay. What a time that was.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. I remember that pretty well because shortly thereafter everything sort of changed.
Abby Hart
 Oh gosh. So you said 22 mill in 2019?
Gilly Artigues
 Yes.
Abby Hart
 Okay. And then in 2020, you guys took a bit of a dip.
Gilly Artigues
 Oh, big dip. I think we did about 16,000,000.
Abby Hart
 Oh, wow. Okay. And then 2021?
Gilly Artigues
 And in 2021, we're back up to 20.
Abby Hart
 Okay. And then 2022, you're aiming for 22,000,000 again?
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. We're projecting about 22,000,000. We're on pace for that.
Abby Hart
 2019 was a record year?
Gilly Artigues
 Yes.
Abby Hart
 Okay. So I used to be editor at Landscape Management Magazine and-
Gilly Artigues
 Cool.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. I think that everyone said that 2019 was a record year for them. The best majority of people that we interviewed said that it was yeah.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 [inaudible 00:14:36] big years. Okay.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 Let's see. All right. Late. Yeah. So February, March. Okay, fantastic. So you came on board... Let's take it way back to the history of Pleasant Places. Gilly, you said that your dad started in 1984?
Gilly Artigues
 1984.
Abby Hart
 And your dad is Palmer Guy?
Gilly Artigues
 Guy Artigues who you probably haven't spoken to. He does other stuff. He's not really in the day to day operations anymore.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. Can you give me kind of the history of Pleasant Places and how it started and what brought you on board and where it is today?
Gilly Artigues
 Sure. Dad's a worker. He left high school and started working for a lawn care company and figured, ""Why am I working for somebody else? I'm doing all the work anyway. I might as well own my own business."" So he did that in 1984 and then let's see we're rocking and rolling. I would say probably the mid 2000s, 2004, 5, 6, we really started really growing. So in 2007, Pleasant Places did $17,000,000 worth of business, which was at the time a record year for us. And then in 2009 everything sort of fell out. 2008, 2009 we did $6,000,000 in business. Had a huge drop off, major problems. We didn't even know if we were going to survive, frankly, but dad's persistence and work ethic and all that stuff sort of kept us afloat.
And then we started gradually growing again 2012, we're doing 10 or 11,000,000. 2015, we're up to like 15,000,000. And then, like I said, 2019, we're 22,000,000 company. Started out doing more really whatever he could get obviously residential stuff and that kind of thing. And before you know it, you're maintaining apartment complexes and shopping centers. And then the owner of the apartment complex ask if you can plan him, redo his pool area and we just sort of went from there. And we're located in Charleston, South Carolina, which has grown exponentially in that period of time as well. So we have benefited from our market exploding really over the last 20 years or so. But it's a good story, man. It's just a regular guy started up a company with a truck and a trailer and you look I guess 38 years later now, and 250 people, and 72 trucks and all kind of stuff going on. So it's pretty cool. Pretty cool.
Abby Hart
 That's amazing.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 Really wow. I love the Charleston area and it seems like there's really phenomenal landscaping work and phenomenal landscaping businesses there. So I'm glad we're getting a chance to talk.
Gilly Artigues
 Well, that's-
Abby Hart
 Yeah.
Gilly Artigues
 I'm glad you like because we take care of everything for the city of Charleston so I'm glad you said that.
Abby Hart
 Oh, wow. It's gorgeous. How long have you had that account?
Gilly Artigues
 Oh, let's see. We got that account I want to say probably I could tell you exactly but 2017, 2018, so four or five years, something like that.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Wow. That's huge.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 There's so much to maintain and it's always so impeccable so that's fantastic. Okay. So 72 trucks, 250 employees, you're shooting for you're projected at 22,000,000 this year what's your customer and service mix? So what's the percentage of residential versus commercial?
Gilly Artigues
 So we don't do any residential maintenance.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Gilly Artigues
 We work for some home builders. So our mix with something like this, it's 37 ish percent maintenance, which are all commercial contracts, whether the municipal or multifamily HOAs, then the rest of it, the other 63 or whatever percent is new construction. And of that 60 plus percent about 14% of that, 15% of that is home builders.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Gilly Artigues
 And then the rest of it is commercial construction.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha.
Gilly Artigues
 Big stuff like that.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. So you started out-
Gilly Artigues
 We do landscape irrigation, hardscape, concrete, pavers, walls, things like that and then obviously maintenance. We cut the grass.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. Okay. Great. Do you guys do any lawn care?
Gilly Artigues
 Excuse me.
Abby Hart
 Do you guys do any lawn care?
Gilly Artigues
 Lawn care?
Abby Hart
 Yeah. Any like chemical applications?
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. Yeah. We just include that in our maintenance portfolio.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Gilly Artigues
 But we don't do it on Sally's yard. It's commercial contracts.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. Yeah. I think that some companies kind of-
Gilly Artigues
 It's regional I feel like.
Abby Hart
 Oh really?
Gilly Artigues
 It's pretty standard for your maintenance contract to include the basic a couple fertilization every year, and irrigation audit and spot treatment of weeds or whatever.
Abby Hart
 I wonder if it's also a size thing because I feel like big operations such as yourself are probably more likely to be able to pay an applicator and have people on staff as opposed to well-
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. It's also because the customers that you're working for. When you have a... There's a company in our market, they're called Yard Art and they are a 100% residential, high end residential, I would say. I actually have a lot of respect for them. I think they do a really good job, but the way they do it I thought was interesting. What they do is they give the customer, and I believe it's online, like a menu. $40 to cut the grass, 10 bucks to edge it, trim the bushes is this and then fertilizers is that so on and so on. So I feel like when it's your own yard, it's a little different but when it's a big commercial... You're dealing with an apartment complex that every year they do budgeting or a municipality every year they do budgeting they just say, ""Here's what I want. How much is it to do?"" And they don't all this extra stuff. The only things that aren't included in our contracts are pine straw and seasonal color annual flour.
Abby Hart
 Okay. All right. Cool. That is helpful. So how did you get involved in the business Gilly and when did that happen?
Gilly Artigues
 Sixth grade. I was a bit rambunctious when I was a school boy. I wasn't particularly good at being quiet in class, as you might suspect and I went to Catholic school too, they're pretty strict. So anytime I would get in trouble or whatever and this is from when I was little, little, probably like third or fourth grade, but in sixth grade my dad had me work on a crew. I was making minimum wage, just digging holes all summer five, six days a week. And of course I was making seven bucks an hour or whatever it was and that was awesome to me. You're in sixth grade or going into seventh grade. So I got involved in that respect then. And then obviously in the summers man, I always had a job if I wanted one, right?
So eighth grade year, you're starting to grow up a little bit and you're wanting to take girls to the movies or whatever you need, the little extra coin you go to work. That's how it was in our family. And then I guess in earnest, I started working here in 2015, like full time employee that kind of stuff. So 2015 I started working here. I started out in sales about a year or so later I got promoted to the director of maintenance. So I was in charge of the entire maintenance division. Then another year or two after that vice president and then a couple years later I'm the president. So I've been here, I want to say seven or eight years full time employee. But literally my entire life I've been working here.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Was there ever a question that... Were you ever-
Gilly Artigues
 [inaudible 00:26:42] what I was going to do?
Abby Hart
 Yeah. Like that you would do something else?
Gilly Artigues
 Oh no. Never, ever not in my mind anyway. I saw what my dad had built and that was impressive to me. And I saw how much he loved it and to be able to... It's cool when you're a kid you're driving down the road and you see one of your trucks and you go, ""Oh, that's that's my dad's business. That's pretty cool."" So, that's when you're a kid you just think your dad hung the moon you just want to be just like him.
So now I'm I'm in my twenties and I'm looking to see... You're starting to think about the rest of your life and stuff like that and you just look at it and you say, okay, what is it you want out of life? And you want to be successful and you want nice stuff and all those things and what's the best way to achieve that, the quickest way to achieve that. And that is to come into a business that's already established. Honestly it wouldn't have mattered to me if we were a landscape business or a plumbing business or whatever, it's family business. And I've seen all the blood, sweat and tears my dad put into it and I'm excited to carry on his legacy and I'm proud that he trusts me enough to let me run it.
Abby Hart
 That's phenomenal. That's great, Gilly. So you came on board in 2015, you mentioned that as soon as you came in, you wanted to make changes.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. Pretty much yeah.
Abby Hart
 Okay. So what was the operation like when you started and how did you realize that you needed software?
Gilly Artigues
 So in 2015 when I started I wasn't looking at any financials I was a maintenance sales guy. So all I really cared was going out there and getting more maintenance accounts and getting some commission and then going out on the boat or going to the bar or whatever Friday night I wasn't really worried about all that. And then I'd say when I became the director of maintenance, I started asking questions because now I'm looking at the profitability of the maintenance division. And I would ask questions like ""Hey Joe Blow, you're the account manager for this property how many hours are budgeted when they're per visit? And they just looked at me like I was speaking French or something.
And that's when I started to say, okay, so we're going out there and we've always had a good product. The product's always been good. The customer service has always been good, but the financials, the profitability and just the overall organization we weren't organized enough. So that's when I started to say, all right, hold on a second here. What are we doing here? What do you mean you don't know the budgeted hours, right? How do you know if you're making money on this account if you don't know how much we're willing to spend there? That doesn't make sense.
So I started sort of, not sort of, it was actually sort of heavy handed, but I said, ""Listen, y'all got to know this stuff. You need to know all this."" And we'd have meetings on it and we were doing it the old fashioned way, you get a report out of QuickBooks. Here's what we get per month. Here's what we get per year 52 visits per year. Here's what it comes out to per visit. Here's what we pay per man hour, et cetera, et cetera and that's a process. That takes a while especially when you're running the division at the same time and these guys are running their crews at the same time were trying to do all this. So it was time consuming and different fires to put out every day and things of that nature. So, that's the first time. And I wasn't even looking company wide because I wasn't worried about it. It was just my division.
And then a couple years later, I was the VP and my main job really was to make sure that we had the money in the bank to do what we were doing. So then I said, all right, well I need to really look under the hood and see what's going on here. And that's when I started seeing probably 2018 or so late 2017 or early 2018, I started looking and said, ""Oh no, this ain't right."" And then I would go and I would ask questions to people that you would presume would have the answer and I was never able to get a satisfactory answer or I would get an answer.
You ask the same question to three different people and you get three different answers. You know, what's the target margin on this job right here and you ask the estimator, you ask the president of the company and then you ask the guy running the job and they all either say, ""Man, I don't know."" Or they give you an answer that is different than the other guy. So that's when I said, okay we got to do something. We got to sort of automate some of these processes because we're spending too much time doing stuff that could be automated. Easy stuff, filling out a schedule on the phone with our purchaser. Trying to get an order together or getting a PO and all that kind of stuff. So I said we got to automate it. And then I started looking at some other stuff like there's, I don't even really remember their names, but there's some other ones that are like, I guess, a little cheaper and you do a little free trial and that kind of stuff and none of it really was what we were looking for. It all sort of came and went.
And I had a guy call me from Aspire. I was VP at the time. Like I said, it was probably 2018 or 2019, and the guy called me and I basically said, ""No."" I said, ""Dude, no, it's too expensive. I don't get a free trial. I don't even know if it's going to work. I'm locked in for a year. No way I'm not doing it."" Okay. That's fine. Call me if you ever want to give it a shot kind of thing. I guess the last straw.
So we spent some money. We were going to basically build or incorporate several different softwares into one basically to do what Aspire does and we were getting to the point where it was almost ready and the guy that we had that was helping us do it he, I forget exactly what was happening, but we were doing something and we put all this data in there so much data and the guy didn't think through something. It was something like this maintenance contracts and commercial install contracts had to be entered differently or coded differently or something like that and this dumb he messed up on that. And basically it was like, we did a week's worth of work and a week's worth of money for nothing. And I said, ""You know what to hell with this guy? He don't know what he's doing. We're out. Bye-bye. See you later.""
Abby Hart
 Oh.
Gilly Artigues
 And then I said, ""You know what, I'm calling that guy from Aspire back because-""
Abby Hart
 Oh, no.
Gilly Artigues
 ""... I'm done being a holdout. I don't care how expensive it is."" And it's really not that bad you know?
Abby Hart
 Right.
Gilly Artigues
 When you think about it, the money that we pay we more than make that up. I ain't saying charge me more, but it's nothing compared to the increased profitability in the savings. It's negligible. Again, and I said this before, the only regret I had is in 2018 or 2019, whenever I was talking to that seller I told them no, should have implemented it sooner.
Abby Hart
 Wow. Okay. There's a lot to process there, Gilly. So how long was that process to incorporate solutions into one kind of...
Gilly Artigues
 Oh, it was months. We were almost done and we were probably in the middle of the third month. So it was probably 120 day process.
Abby Hart
 Oh.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 So were you using all of these solutions prior to or was it just like-
Gilly Artigues
 It was all new stuff and-
Abby Hart
 Wow.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 Okay. Prior to onboarding with Aspire you were trying to build this solution. I heard you mention QuickBooks. What other solutions were you using before you used Aspire before you onboarded?
Gilly Artigues
 That was basically it. We used QuickBooks was all the billing out of QuickBooks. All the paying the bills. I mean, we did everything out of QuickBooks and then everything else... We have like servers and everything that hold that, save everything and all that, but we didn't have a workflow software. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm telling you.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. That's what I thought [inaudible 00:39:05] that I wasn't sure. I wanted to clarify that.
Gilly Artigues
 [inaudible 00:39:08] did in 1975, that's what we were doing basically. Except we had cell phones and internet.
Abby Hart
 Wow.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 Okay. Wow. All right. So QuickBooks for billing financials. I mean, you basically just had spreadsheets and meetings.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. Spreadsheets and pieces of paper.
Abby Hart
 Wow. I mean, that's really phenomenal.
Gilly Artigues
 [inaudible 00:39:40].
Abby Hart
 What was that, Gilly?
Gilly Artigues
 I said, we just had huge file cabinets full of stuff. It was wild.
Abby Hart
 Kudos to you guys for making it.
Gilly Artigues
 It sounds crazy when you think about that, it does. You think about that and you're like, wait, you're doing $20,000,000 and you're working off of a spreadsheet Excel and you're writing that every day on a piece of paper, wow, it's impressive in a way-
Abby Hart
 It is, it truly is honestly. Can you tell me how you guys did like timekeeping? Was it kind of the same thing? Like go to one piece of paper.
Gilly Artigues
 So they go out there. They have a schedule and a clipboard. They write down, I got to this job at this time. Here's what I did. Here's when I left. [inaudible 00:40:43] paper, every crew had a cubby. You go you put your schedule in the cubby in the office. At the end of the day, somebody comes and collects those. They go through it, mark everything, that's billable, billable. And then it goes to payroll and they take those hours. And everybody has to sign the schedule at the bottom. So you would get into problems where, ""Oh, I worked, but I forgot to sign the schedule,"" and stuff like that. And the handwriting, geez, Louise. Sometimes you couldn't even read it. So it's caveman stuff.
Abby Hart
 Wow. Okay. So other than you are kind of in desperate times because of this solution falling apart, what made you choose Aspire? Presumably you had other people kind of chasing you down for your-
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. So I asked... In this area we have some permitable competitors or component and two of them are customers of yours and you know how it goes, man people move around. You get an account manager from over there and they come over here and you sit down and you ask them because you have a lot of respect for that competing business. And you say, ""How did y'all do scheduling? How did y'all keep track of time over there?"" And they said, ""Aspire."" ""Well, how'd you like that?"" ""It was great, man. It was easy to use,"" et cetera, et cetera. And then combined with the fact that I had talked to that guy and gone through sort of the demo or whatever I already had sort of in the back of my mind, that Aspire was an option but number one, knowing that, and I'll tell you it was Yellowstone and The Greenery.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. I've interviewed Lee Edwards.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. They're good at what they do.
Abby Hart
 They are.
Gilly Artigues
 They're probably mad at y'all for bringing us on as a customer because we're starting to kick their a little bit.
Abby Hart
 Oh really? Oh man. No, it's all good. You're just pushing each other to be better.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. Now we have the same tools. So, that was it. I liked Aspire. When I did the demo I said, ""Wow, this is good,"" but I didn't trust it because you know how demos are. And I had been through demos before and the demo looks great and then you get to try it, it doesn't work. But when people came in from other companies that used it and they said, ""This is what we use."" And you look at that company and you say, wow they're really organized. They have all their stuff together and they don't seem to miss beat. Maybe that's the answer.
And then when I talked to whoever the guy was that ultimately sold it to us I asked about the implementation process, how's it work and all that and it was really the onboarding, the process, they really took time to explain how it would work. Any question I had, they had the answer ready and it was all true. When we went to go, it's time to go, it's time to start now, it's time to start implementing the software and doing the onboarding, starting the process they were very, very helpful. It was very easy. And like I said, they had answers for everything.
Abby Hart
 Can we talk really briefly actually about the implementation process? So I imagine-
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 ... that you guys went through, what, three months? 90 days? Was it longer?
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. It 90 days or so. It was 90 or so and they walked us through it. They said, look, this is what we're going to do first. At the beginning of the process they said, ""Here's how it's going to go. First we're doing this. Next we're doing this so on and so forth, 90 days were done."" And throughout the process, if you had trouble with something, if you had a question about something, they were there to help. We had countless Zoom meetings and calls and all that kind of stuff to help us get it going.
I'm thinking about it now and I'm sitting here doing this interview talking about how great Aspire is and it is great and it's great, but I don't really want my competitors to use Aspire because it's such a great tool and it's so helpful that I know that their success will improve if they use it. So really I should be telling all my competitors that Aspire sucks, but I won't. But anyway, the implementation and onboarding was great. They were helpful.
They had people that help you with the data entry. So it's not like you have to shut down your office for 90 days because you're working. You're in the middle of jobs. You don't really have time to do everything by yourself. You don't have the money to just go hire five or six people to come work for 90 days, just sit there and do data entry so when you start using it runs smoothly. It was very simple. Get some customer. Get some price lists into them and that kind of thing. They did the quote on quote manual labor required. They did all the data entry. That kind of stuff. It was a very pleasant experience.
Abby Hart
 That's great. I might have to temper that because I don't know if we're doing that much of that data entry these days.
Gilly Artigues
 Really?
Abby Hart
 I mean, now we have so many... Just especially with the service site acquisition we're growing by a lot and I feel like probably-
Gilly Artigues
 [inaudible 00:48:05] to do that.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. Well, and in part, I think of kind of getting to know the system and the new process with implementation is to make sure that people are entering in data so they know exactly where it is in the system and why it's there and how it connects to everything else.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. I don't know who did it. I don't know if they pushed a button and the computer did it. All I know is I didn't have to go into Aspire and manually-
Abby Hart
 I mean, that's great. That's phenomenal.
Gilly Artigues
 Manually put every single thing. You could take a catalog, you've got thousands of items in your catalog.
Abby Hart
 Yeah.
Gilly Artigues
 Sit there and put all those in one by one is just so time consuming. It would make people say, ""I'm not doing that. If that's what I have to do, I ain't doing it.""
Abby Hart
 Right.
Gilly Artigues
 So however they did it, we appreciate it.
Abby Hart
 That's great. And I'm happy to hear that the implementation process was pretty seamless for you. I'm assuming that you had an internal team that was kind of running it.
Gilly Artigues
 We did. We had about five people estimating, accounting and then myself basically and purchasing, helping with all that.
Abby Hart
 Cool. All right. Can you tell me a story or instance of how Aspire changed your business for the better? What I'm looking for here... I mean, obviously that's all we've been talking about but-
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 Do you have a situation, or a big client, or a crazy project where you were able to use the Aspire workflow from beginning to end or even, I mean, doesn't even need to be that broad it could even be-
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. So one example I could think of just off the top of my head, our largest maintenance account pays us roughly $55,000 a month, or they were at the time. Now our town of Mount Pleasant is our largest but at the time that we implemented Aspire that was our biggest commercial maintenance account. And we weren't losing money, but we weren't really making it either. It was low margin work. We got Aspire and you're able to put, not put on paper, but illustrate the best way to attack this account. Now we've been servicing this account for near 20 years and to think that you've been...
Now when you managed account for 20 years, you've been cutting the grass as a huge HOA, for 20 years you would think that the most efficient way to get it done. You would think that. So we're sitting here thinking, well, this is a $55,000 a month account and this is just what it takes to do. It just is. We get Aspire and our gross margins on that job were higher than most honestly but still low, maybe 30. It's like the mid forties now. It's like 46 or 47%. The same exact people, same exact crew doing the work, same exact community, same exact equipment, same exact everything. Same exact everything except for Aspire. That's the only change.
There's tons of stuff like that. We do a job like, this isn't a huge portion of our mix but the home builder stuff. So we're in a community and when we rolled Aspire out, when we started officially using Aspire we had done... I want to say there's like 90 something homes being built in this community and I wanted to say, we probably did about 15 of them at that point and they're all basically the same thing. They all have pretty much the same landscape package, pretty much the same price point. It's all been agreed upon prior and you're getting the same amount basically for every single lot you do. So if you're getting round numbers, $10,000 a lot, and you're coming away at the end of the day and gross you're making two grand or something like that a lot. And then you get Aspire the exact same community, exact same plant package, again, exact same everything but all of a sudden you've more than doubled your margins, how is that? How is that possible? What...
Abby Hart
 Wow.
Gilly Artigues
 The only explanation is Aspire. And it's a combination of all those different things, scheduling, budgeting, time entry, purchasing, all that kind of stuff. It's wild. It's wild. You can look at anything like that, particularly maintenance accounts, and you won't find one that the margins haven't improved on. You won't find one, not one.
Abby Hart
 Wow. That's phenomenal. I think that the testimonial in itself, Gilly. Are there any other major metrics that you can point to in the business overall?Obviously you guys are bouncing back on revenue, but I don't know if you have any. Let's see, hold on. You mentioned, hold on. We had talked about margins earlier, but is there anything else as far as like, I don't know, retention or I don't know, estimating or anything that's gotten better than we can kind of say-
Gilly Artigues
 We've gotten better at enhancements, like selling enhancements on our properties. That's another thing that's improved since we implemented aspire. And I think it's because the account manager... So that doesn't go to estimating.
Abby Hart
 Right.
Gilly Artigues
 You're an account manager and you're riding your property, looking around, checking on everything or whatever and you pull up and you say, ""Hey what would look good here? Seven or $8,000 worth of stuff."" And the ability for somebody that's a field manager to come in or on their laptop, just bang out a quick proposal that is number one, visible. So I can see it. Everybody can see it. Does this meet the margins, et cetera, et cetera. And number two, it's uniform. So you don't have an account manager that manages something over on this side of town pricing the same exact thing at a different price than the guy on the other side of town. And when you have these property management companies that have properties all over the place, the same property manager overseas the one on that side of town and this side of town. So-
Abby Hart
 That makes sense.
Gilly Artigues
 ... if it's something that says a Palm tree costs a hundred bucks from one guy for a property over here, and then she gets another estimate for a Palm tree for 200 bucks from this guy over here on this side of town, from the same exact company she's saying, ""What the hell's going on? Are these people trying to get one over on me or what?"" So being able to have that uniformity and being able for those guys to be able to quickly hammer those out and not have to... A big part of it is these field guys, they don't really have the time to go and research and call and say, ""Hey, how much would I have to pay to get this plant package?"" And et cetera, cetera, they just go in and they start typing in a word. It pops up. It tells you what we charge for it bit. Bam, boom nice and easy. So enhancements revenue has definitely increased as well.
Abby Hart
 That's great.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 We're a little bit over. Gilly, do you have like another 10 minutes? Is it-
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. I got plenty of time.
Abby Hart
 Okay, perfect. Thank you. You just gave me so much right now. So, that's phenomenal. So enhancements are up. It looks like margins are up on everything. Overall scheduling has gotten better. Is there anything you can talk about as far as, your people? 250 people that is a lot of people to manage and to train and all of that. Can you talk a little bit about how Aspire has helped with labor management and culture?
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. Sure. I told you about how we had to do our hours before and obviously it's different now with Aspire but these guys... So here people are incentivized to do better. And they've been incentivized for six years or so. So it dates back pre Aspire. But from the... Let me put it like this, employees they want to do a good job but you have to give them the tools to do it. You have to give them the opportunity to use their potential.
So when you're sort of, like I said, we used to meet a lot and that to me is sort of micromanaging. ""What are you doing tomorrow?"" I'm back in here tomorrow I ask you what you're doing the next day. And if we see a problem with that, then we're just going to change everything right then and there. So these guys, particularly the managers from the heads of the division who are senior people here to the guy, the crew leader that drives the truck, all of these guys you can just tell their confidence level has grown, their product has improved. Putting the money aside, the product has improved, the customer service. People don't like to be kept waiting. If I say, we're going to be done by Wednesday and we're not done by Wednesday, it's a problem.
These guys are, they're just so much better able to do the job that they're required to do at a high level. And before we got Aspire, I told all these guys, I said, ""Look, I know y'all have the potential to do it and it is on us as a company to give you the tools and the visibility to do that."" Picture pre Aspire you have a $1,000,000 job, a $1,000,000 job. You go in. You have it estimated out. At the end of the job, you find out that you didn't hit your goal. You were at 28% gross. Now you're looking at the guy who ran that job and saying, ""What the hell bro, what happened?"" And he doesn't really have anything to say. There's really no way he can answer that because he doesn't have the visibility into the process.
And there was really no real accountability because there was no way to know where the error occurred. What step in the process messed up? Did we estimate it wrong? Did we buy it wrong? Did we execute it wrong? Is it a combination of all those things? We weren't really able to nail that down. And we used to have to go and do it all by phone or email or whatever too. You want something to be billed, you either come to the meeting or you call the billing person and say, ""Email, hey, go ahead and build this"" whatever. And when there would be a disconnect or a gap in communication or something I think that created some friction between say production and accounting or purchasing or something like that.
Aspire has really helped us gel it together and these guys and gals that work here on the production side are, like I said, it's just... You can't fully appreciate it unless you were here and saw before and after. But these guys, it's just wild that we weren't using their full potential before, because these guys are smart. They're good at what they do. They care about the job and they want to be successful. They want the company to be successful, but you just have to give them the tools to do that. We finally did and now the rest is history.
Abby Hart
 Wow. That's great. I could not have said better. It sounds like people are really empowered to mention-
Gilly Artigues
 Oh my God grow.
Abby Hart
 I mean, that's great.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. It's wild. We have a guy here, I'm not going to say his name, but we have a guy here who runs one of our divisions, very timid, quiet person, been here a while. And my dad always told me ""This guy, ah, I just don't know if he has what it takes to be the person in his position. I just don't think he has the disposition. I don't think he has the skillset to be this guy for a $20,000,000 company. I just don't see that."" And I said ""I disagree."" I think whatever. Now this dude, his division is kicking. He is assertive, confident, knows it backwards and front. And I haven't gone up to him and asked him and saying, ""Hey, well, you know what happened?"" I know what happened.
The guy was able to start controlling his own division, scheduling it out in advance, painting a picture in his mind of what the next week, month quarter is going to look like for his division. See what his budgets are. Make sure we're sticking to those budgets and being able to make adjustments on the fly in real time. Instead of me coming to him after the fact and saying, ""What the hell happened?"" He can be proactive instead of reactive. And once that happens, once you... And again, it's hard to appreciate unless you're part of it but when you're slugging along and, I hold meetings every week with the production people, and when you're slugging along an old Gill is not very fun to be around in those meetings because we're consistently missing our targets it takes a toll on you. It takes a toll on your give a, as we say down here.
Abby Hart
 Right.
Gilly Artigues
 And once those guys get a taste of success, the success breeds success. It's like you start losing weight or working out. You first start working out and you see a little bit of change in your body. You start hitting it even harder and you've become sort of obsessed with it and that is what I think has happened around here. People are saying, ""Wow, it really is possible to do what Gilly's been asking us to do for all these years and I really can do it. And it really ain't that hard."" And now they're just... I could not be happier with the way our managers are running this company because listen, I'm the president, but I don't plant the first bush.
Abby Hart
 Right.
Gilly Artigues
 I don't cut the first blade of grass or I don't do none of that kind of stuff. It's all them. They make the business run. They are the reason we're successful and all they needed was the right tools to do their job. That's it.
Abby Hart
 Wow. Wow. Okay. Gilly, so to that end, what are your current business goals and how will Aspire help you achieve them? So I imagine-
Gilly Artigues
 My goal?
Abby Hart
 Yeah. Current business goals.
Gilly Artigues
 So what we're trying to do currently, obviously we have a revenue goal. There's a way to track that in Aspire and again in real time. And then we have sort of longer term goals. We want to expand out of this market. I want to go a 100 miles up the coast of South Carolina. A 100 miles down the coast of South Carolina. And I want to have a major presence all up and down South Carolina, and then we're going to go inland and other states, things like that. Well, the challenge in doing that is having a system, right? You think, how can I go down the street here in order a Big Mac from McDonald's in Charleston, South Carolina, then I could get on a plane and fly to the other end of the country in California and order of Big Mac in California. It's the exact same ingredients, cooked the exact same way, it takes the exact same. How do they do that? Well, they have a system.
Having a system like Aspire that I mean, it's baked in. It's plug and play. You just put somebody in there that understands how to use it and you can expand as much as you want. And I can be here in Charleston headquarters and be able to look and see very quickly how everything's going in these other branches. So we're already all over pry county area as we call it, which is probably a 100 square miles or so, but being able to go two hours away and replicate what we're doing here, the challenge used to be that we don't have the processes and the procedures that would... Like we didn't have those so it would mean that somebody like me, or my dad or my brother would have to go and work there full time to make sure that we're upholding the standard and doing things the right way and all that kind of stuff. But now we could do that easily, but you still do have to find the right guy. You still do have to find somebody to go out there and sell it and all that kind of stuff.
But we used to say, and I used to bring this up with dad because dad's wants to grow, grow, grow and I would say, ""Dad, we're here every day and we can't get it right here. What makes you think that we're going to open up an office two hours away and be better than we are here? That doesn't make any sense."" But now we have the processes and the procedures that are foolproof, easy to do and uniform across the board.
So our goal is expansion and Aspire makes it palatable to do without too much real work. It's a computer program. This is how we run the business. Can you use a computer at a high school level? Not even, I mean, my son could probably do this. He's 11 years old. Very easy to use once it's all set up. And now that we have God, it's going to be huge when we get to that point.
Abby Hart
 Wow. This is [inaudible 01:12:28].
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 Not to end on a what a slightly negative note, but what are your big challenges? I mean, obviously the growth will be a big challenge, but is there anything that you're like this is a real issue for us. For many people it's hiring. I don't know if that's an issue for but-
Gilly Artigues
 Hiring's a huge issue. This economy is a little funky.
Abby Hart
 Yeah.
Gilly Artigues
 Right. Gas prices are crazy. Supply chain, et cetera, et cetera, you can't really... One thing that we're having to do is constantly update our prices to be in line with our costs from our suppliers and stuff like that. So there are no real challenges to us that aren't a challenge to small businesses at large.
Abby Hart
 Right.
Gilly Artigues
 It's sort of the same for everybody. Hiring, finding people, paying those people, keeping those people with the labor market as tight as it is a challenge and then just your regular, everyday stuff, prices and gas man.
Abby Hart
 Right.
Gilly Artigues
 That's it but there's nothing that we see that we're not going to be able to work through. We hope anyway.
Abby Hart
 That's great. You said you're constantly updating prices to align with your suppliers and the cost you guys are incurring on your end. Is that an issue with Aspire? Is that an issue with your customers? Like how do you kind of have that delicate conversation?
Gilly Artigues
 Well, people aren't stupid. So customers know that prices have gone up. It's not really a challenge in Aspire and how often do we have to do it? Well, for some stuff, you really don't have to do it that often at all. Every few months maybe or whenever we get a notice from a supplier that says, ""Hey, these are the changes we're getting in our prices or whatever,"" but some stuff, aluminum you do aluminum fencing or rebar for reinforced concrete, iron, metal products, shoot those get updated shoot maybe every week or every two weeks. And I mean, ain't hard to do and aspire, but it is something that you just have to keep up with. It is what it is.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. Okay, great. This is for another article that I'm working on about like material cost volatility. I might quote you in there as well, Gilly. Okay. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. I have taken up too much of your time, but this has been phenomenal.
Gilly Artigues
 I'm happy to do it. And I won't talk [inaudible 01:15:59] off anymore either but-
Abby Hart
 No, no.
Gilly Artigues
 I met, I guess the founder of Aspire before they sold. I went to a conference in Orlando, Florida technology in landscape and I met the guy and this was only like three or four months after we had implemented the software. The changes were already evident to me. I could already see the improvements. And I went to the booth and I said, ""Look, man, I just want to shake your hand and thank you because Aspire has saved us."" There's no real other way to put that. We couldn't continue doing what we were doing without making major changes and I almost started crying talking to the guy. I really did.
Your dad's business that he put his heart and soul into that is your entire life as well, and provides for your family and all that and you see it, I don't want to say failing because we're still doing our thing or whatever, but it was limping for sure. And I'm telling you, man, that this Aspire thing has really... It's the best decision we've made at this company in 40 years. No question about it. And I am so thankful that software exists and that we started up, man. I really am. I really am.
Abby Hart
 Wow. Wow. That's phenomenal, Gilly. That is definitely going in here. No question. Thank you so much for your time. I will be in touch hopefully later this week, maybe early next, because I really want to get this drafted while all this is fresh in my brain. But in the meantime, Gilly, would you be able to have either yourself or I don't know if you guys have a marketing person, would you be able to send some photography our way of your crews?
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 It'd be great-
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. My brother does all that. My brother does all that stuff. I'll give it to you.
Abby Hart
 Phenomenal. Maybe one of you and your dad that would-
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. Oh yeah. We got all that. We got all that. I'm not really big on all that stuff pictures and all that stuff. My brother's a little more into it than I am, but I'll have him do that. We actually have a... They wrote an article about us in the business journal down here.
Abby Hart
 Oh great.
Gilly Artigues
 Maybe last year or something and we got pictures of the three of us-
Abby Hart
 Yes, please.
Gilly Artigues
 ... out there in the field. So I'll put Palmer in touch with you and whatever you need he'll get for you.
Abby Hart
 Fantastic. Well, thank you. Thank you so much, Gilly. I really appreciate your time. And we're so lucky that you partnered with Aspire that you guys are thriving.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah. We're grateful and thankful. And if you need anything from us... I mean, I'll do a commercial for aspire for free. I really would. I can't tell [inaudible 01:19:34].
Abby Hart
 Do not come to us because we will send somebody down there actually. I'll actually let the rest of our marketing team know that, that offer stands because we would love that.
Gilly Artigues
 Yeah, absolutely. Whatever you need, let me know. Okay.
Abby Hart
 All right. Thanks so much, Gilly. Take care.
Gilly Artigues
 Bye.
Abby Hart
 Bye-bye."

 Okay, great. Amanda, you should have received our questions, but if, Kim, and I have any additional questions, we'll jump in with them, but we'll go by these one by one. And yeah, this is just intelligence about the janitorial industry and about ServiceMaster by Stratos, specifically. But yeah, could you jump in by telling us a little bit about ServiceMaster by Stratos? How long you've been there? Background, customer mix, service mix, all that?
Amanda Maness
 Okay. I am in my fifth, I guess in October, it'll be five years here. That's how long I've been here. The business is owned by, Chris, and Stacy McCall, and they previously owned another franchise that was started by Chris's dad. It's very much a family business type thing, but has been a ServiceMaster franchise, I think, since at least the 80s. It's majority women owned now by Stacy McCall, and that's since 2009, I believe. And that's when we renamed everything to ServiceMaster by Stratus. But they often and have received awards from ServiceMaster for being in the business 30 and 40 years because of their longevity with the family business before. Let's see, that's the background of the business.
The customer mix, we are 8% of our locations are event and venue, 7% are healthcare, 6% are in kind donations where I know we do boys and girls club, that thing. 8% is industrial distribution areas. 58% is property management, which is owner occupied. The owner of the business hires us directly. And then 12% is property management companies where they hire us to service the facilities. That's a mix of our business. And as far as revenue goes, I think we were at 12 million before the pandemic. I think we're at 10 million now, as far as best estimate. Let's see, customer mix. I mean, I gave you the percentages of our verticals, but basically, we have a mix, event and venue, that would be college football and we have the NBA arena here in Memphis, the professional baseball and soccer arena.
And then we have a large part of our business is schools. We consider the schools a totally different animal, so that wasn't in the percentages that I just gave you. If it was really important, I'm sure I could just recalculate it with the schools and percent of total. We do 40 of the local schools, so that's a pretty big part of our business. And other than that, we mostly do commercial office buildings and things like that outside of the event and venue and a little bit of healthcare and the education piece. The service mix that we do is, we do a lot of project jobs, like maybe carpet cleaning or special floors, think like fancy office or condo buildings that have a specific marble floor or something like that. Those are our one off type things. And then as far as our bread and butter, it's just regular janitorial and custodial services where we have specialized disinfection options after COVID-19, where we use electrostatic sprayers or certain disinfectants that guarantee microbe free surface for X amount of hours or something like that.
And then we occasionally do, obviously, offer event support. So our event and venue, we would think of your favorite NBA team. Here we have the Memphis Grizzlies. So we take care of their administrative offices and the facility in general, but then we also do all of the events, whether it be a concert or one of the NBA games, or they also use that for college graduations and things that. We provide event support on top of our regular day in and day out support in that way.
Number of employees, we are in between 350 and 400 currently. We would be at 400 if all of our open positions were filled. And I think I printed out your sheet of your questions. I was trying to look through, tell us a little bit about ServiceMaster by Stratus? I think that's it as far as what I can think about our structure of the company. We run pretty lean on the administrative side, which I'm sure most businesses are trying to do that as well. But I think we run extra lean for our size of total employees, or that's my opinion. If you have questions regarding that, there's some good and bad things about that, but otherwise I will. Am I missing anything?
Abby
 I think that's great. What do you say run lean on the admin side? How many people are on the admin side, I guess versus people who are actually completing the projects?
Amanda Maness
 Okay. There's me, I'm a project manager and we have a resource specialist that just helps with various administrative tasks. We have an asset manager that deals with all of our vehicles, equipment, and technology device. We have a mobile device management software that we use for all laptop, iPhones and stuff that. And we have an in-house person like an asset manager, an asset assistant, I guess you would say, that helps with repair of some of our cleaning equipment or just making sure everything's running. We have a whole bunch of trucks and vans and they take care of all those or that person takes care of all those. And we have a contracted part-time payroll person that is not a full-time employee, a contracted HR benefits person that is not a full-time employee.
And then we have the two business owners, Chris, and Stacy McCall, and they do a lot of the taxes, normal business owner tasks. And then Chris does a lot of the estimating for sales and estimating of jobs for things that we're going after. And we have one recruiter that is basically assigned to interview and then run background checks and things that, and keep apprised of all the open positions like hire for new things, but also hire for current accounts that have open positions coming. That's our makeup as far as administrative staff goes and considering business size and how many people we hire a year and that thing, I think it's pretty lean
Abby
 Sounds pretty lean for sure. All right. Thanks, Amanda. That's great. What's the biggest challenge or stress you currently face in running your business?
Amanda Maness
 I think most people would probably have the same answer and that is hiring, and it's also setting expectations of our customers. For instance, it's hard for us to hire people and get them to stay. They're not leaving immediately, but we have a lot of people that have tenure of five years or more, but then that turnover and that one or two years is really, really high. And we do statistics and analytics on that yearly so that we can understand what's going on. And we also thought maybe the same people were going back out the door within a month or two.
And that isn't the case. They're staying with us a little bit, but not six months or more, or the majority of them rather. It's people and then getting people to want to work for us. And then it's also setting our customers expectations. That's a big challenge because the price was X before, but now we can't get people to work at your facility if we don't at least pay them Y amount of dollars per hour. And so it's revisiting that with our customers and trying to communicate to them that anybody that they would hire would have these same struggles in this current labor market. And this is what the new cost would be and just trying to...
Most of what we do now is to make them a part of the conversation of, we're trying to get people closer to, or as close as possible to a living wage based on some accounts are only four hours at night. So it's someone's part-time job, but we're trying to get closer to that number so that we can be competitive in the marketplace. And therefore, that cost will translate to a new billing amount of this. And we try to take them on that narrative or that journey so that they understand we're not seeking a cost increase for our profits necessarily, but so that we can remain competitive in the marketplace to fill the open position and also not wanting to lose that business. It's delicate how we explain that anybody that were to come and bid that job would have the same problem of needing to pay a base pay of at least this much per hour or this much per hour in order to remain competitive so that people even want to take that job.
Abby
 What's the range of an hourly right there, if you don't mind me asking, Amanda?
Amanda Maness
 All right. I guess we're in between 10 and $15 an hour hiring, but we're currently negotiating the contract with the school system where everybody would start at 15 and that's a large part of our business. I can get you those percentage numbers, but so basically we're contracting or we're in the middle of negotiations right now to start everybody that works in the schools at $15 an hour. And then we're pretty much starting everything else outside of the schools at least 10, but that ranges all the way up to 17 actually starting.
Abby
 Okay, excellent.
Kim
 I have one quick question. Quick follow-up for you. I've heard a little bit about the debate between using contractors versus employees for janitorial work. I don't know if that's something that you can speak to if you guys have used contractors or if you've found success more with one than the other?
Amanda Maness
 We have used contractors for some select things. For instance, we've had a relationship with one guy for a while that they trust his level of work. And so they've trusted him with more over time. He does a lot of our window and glasswork, and then he does some stuff in a specific part of the county that's a little bit farther out, that's harder for us to staff. As we trusted him more, we gave more work to him. And then he has a couple people under him. The problem that we have had with trusting with contracting is that, oftentimes, your management is hands off because you've now contracted this to be run by a separate smaller entity. And so we don't learn of problems quick enough, where we can solve them and try to keep the account, or it requires both parties to be just really, really great at communicating. And I think that all of us would probably say that we have some work to do on communicating. Do what I mean?
So you're putting in a layer of complexity that is just harder to control and isn't as communicative. We've had some success, some failures and the successes have been when we've worked with somebody over time and have built trust with them. And a lot of people that come in, or a lot of contractors that approach us now, they want a significant piece of something, they want to do all these the bank branches. And so that would be us handing over 20 or 30 of our locations to them. And we're not willing to do that until we've built up some trust with them. And so we find that they're looking for a big win or no win at all. Does that make sense?
Kim
 Yeah, definitely. That's helpful. Thank you.
Abby
 Yeah. Great. Amanda, what are your big goals in your role? I guess we don't have to break them down by three, six or 12 months, but what are the big things you're trying to achieve in your role?
Amanda Maness
 My role as a project manager, I do a lot of different things, but one of my basic things is to just make us operate more efficiently as a business. So sometimes that means that we're rolling out new technology to use for all the employee or supervisors, management. I do a lot of analytics so that we can decide where we're struggling or what's going on with the business? Where are we performing poorly? Where are we performing well? But basically, my job is to find efficiencies and build efficiencies into the business for us. I was telling you how we run really lean on the administrative side earlier, but for supervisors and management that are out in the field, we try to run pretty lean in that regard as well. And there's some technology solutions that are really easy and simple.
They're not hard to grasp, they're easily demonstrated that we have built into our process because it's just helps them remain more organized because they're constantly in and out of their cars and constantly meeting with this team or that team and going from location to location. We've built some things and that helps in that regard. And then my next big goal is that I want to build an HRS system for us that incorporates payroll. That's on human resources, information system that is co-located with our payroll system so that we can be even more efficient on the payroll and HR side. You'll remember that I spoke earlier that we have an HR benefits, part-time contracted person and a part-time payroll person. So having things co-located in an HRS that includes payroll is imperative to us being able to remain successful in that lean model.
And so that's my big goal is, I'm engaging with people right now. And so that's my big goal to roll that out of in the next six to 12 months. That's the thing, I would say, I'm pushing the hardest. And also in our customer service realm is also inspection, inspecting the accounts and making sure that we are providing the services that we promise. And we're also inspecting what we expect our teams to accomplish. And so right now, the software that we use to do that is just very clunky and I don't it. And so I've found one that works a lot better. It's been a process of listing out our business requirements like what do we need in a janitorial inspection software? What inputs and outputs would we need? How do we need it to perform? What hierarchy needs to be built into it where we can assign things to directors, managers, and then supervisors?
And so it's taken a while to find even one that would meet that requirement. That's probably my next thing after the HRS would be to migrate us to a more streamlined inspection software. But the one we have now, it functions okay for what we're doing, but certainly, I wouldn't parade it around and show anybody, hey, look at this great way that we're able to make sure that we're providing our customers needs on a daily basis or weekly basis.
Abby
 Great. This inspection software, is that all that this solution provides or is it tied to any other features aside from inspections?
Amanda Maness
 They have multiple offerings within it. But the only thing that we use is the inspection part. They have a CRM in there and it's again, clunky. And I think they have a job costing tool in there, but that's not very intricate. I guess the one thing you guys need to understand is that we're a ServiceMaster franchise, hence our name ServiceMaster by Stratus. A lot of janitorial companies are independent. We are a franchise. And so some of the benefits of being a franchise is that we get a learning management system that is provided and stewarded by our franchisor, which is ServiceMaster Clean.
There are some things, for instance, a learning management system that we don't have to solve for, because that's part of the fees that we already pay to our franchisor to give us some of those type of things. And I use the learning management system, just as an example. Another thing they give us access to an online MSDS or Safety Data Sheets system. For instance, we don't need to have anything else that has Safety Data Sheets load for any of the chemicals that we use, because everything that we use is housed within that system. You can call the number and it will get texted or emailed to you immediately so that we have access to the latest and greatest all the time in that regard. Those are just an example of two things.
Yeah. The other inspection software that we use is a preferred vendor, I don't want to say partner of ServiceMaster brands or ServiceMaster Clean, but they haven't been innovative at all. It's been operating pretty much the same for the past, the whole time I've been here. They built one dashboard into it, but it doesn't really look that good and it's hard to interpret. As far as I'm concerned, on an end user thing, it really doesn't. I think it's great that you can tell people that you have this dashboard, but are your customers able to read and interpret it? And in our case it's clunky and not very clear. I think I told them it was important to figure out what are people actually able to read and use and isn't helping them. I've tried to have conversations with one of their developers and a project manager there that interfaces with the upper echelon of the company and the developers. And they agree, but I guess they haven't had the funds to really build it in a great way. As a result of that, we've been looking for other things.
Abby
 Awesome.
Amanda Maness
 The other thing about ServiceMaster franchise, they have a whole costing tool that they provide to their franchises. And so that's one of the reasons we never really even looked at using the other tool because the ServiceMaster Clean one is probably even overkill for what goes in there. But yeah, that's part of that, them giving the franchises the tools to remain successful and profitable. They've really put a lot of work into banking that costing tool what it needs to be.
Abby
 Okay, great. I'll ask more specifically about these apps in a second. But what are the biggest obstacles you're experiencing in operating more efficiently and getting this HR system off the ground and getting a handle on these customer inspections?
Amanda Maness
 It's really people. For instance, we're having a hard time hiring hourly people. We also have had a hard time hiring supervisors and managers that stay on board where... You can only drink out of a fire hose for so long. So we have to baby step them into adapting these things. For instance, the first couple weeks they'll be in the field just learning how the account works. And then they'll be given certain tasks of doing time in attendance, time sheet approval and inspections and stuff that. And we have to slow roll that a little bit because we can't just dump it all on them in their first two weeks or one month of employment. And so finding people that can do that well and manage multiple accounts well has been really hard.
A lot of people that we've had work for us have managed people and stuff, but it's been at one location and that has been hard for us to find a true account manager that's used to looking after are the budget of 15 different accounts and the staff at 15 different accounts versus the staff at just one of staff and the budget and schedules at just one location. Again, it's just finding that somebody with experience in this industry. We even looked at people in the restaurant industry because we weren't finding people that had been account managers for other janitorial building service type companies, which is weird because I think once you're comfortable in that space, you would probably want to stay in that space because it's something you know, the devil you know. But that was hard for us. It's been labor on the ground floor and then also later labor in our leadership realm.
And those are all salaried. The management positions are all salaried and benefited and we even have separate package of benefits for people that are not full-time, like a part-time supervisor and stuff. We have beefed up that as well. And I think one of our other obstacles, I would say, is communication. It's hard to communicate with, how many do we have? We have 40 school locations and then we have, I would say, 140 other locations. That's 180 total work locations that our employees are servicing. It's really hard for us to, for instance, tell a manager, ""Hey, can you talk to your staff about this?""
Well, are they talking to their staff at all 15 to 20 places about that? Or are they reverting to a text message because they're just too busy and they didn't get there. I would say communication has been really tough. We have a YouTube channel where we've made some videos, but I really wanted us to invest in something like beehive or I've looked at a few where we have texting camp pains where we can text our employees and say, give them instructions on something or remind them about something. And have that go out to everybody, that way we know everyone is getting the exact same message.
For instance, Memphis here, Memphis has a ton of locations even in the Shelby County and the two surrounding counties are free tax preparation. So we would to talk to our employees about here's where to get your taxes done for free. And all we can do at this point is just tell the management to text them this link of, this is where you can get your taxes done for free. But if we had a means to communicate with them directly, we wouldn't have to do that. And the reason we don't use email is because so many of our employees are not that tech savvy and they often can't get into their email that they give us six months ago or a year ago. And so texting has been, by and large, the most successful way to communicate with our employees, our management and supervisors will tell you that as well. I guess getting a big bang for our buck on subscribing to something that would allow to text people.
And also if we have some of our event stuff, we'll be an art festival or maybe a hot wings festival or something like that, that happens once or twice a year. We would love to be able to text our employees, ""Hey, if you would some overtime or extra hours, please let us know. We're looking to staff, the art festival that's going to be here on this day from this time to this time."" Otherwise, how else can you communicate to people that extra hours are available if their management isn't definitely going to commit to texting them? So communication, mass communication and communication to certain groups of employees is definitely something I can see us leveraging technology for, because I don't think we're doing a good enough job with it in the group text, iPhone group text or whatever method.
Abby
 Great. Yeah. So communication as it exists now is pretty ad hoc and people, your managers just text there, field staff, is that accurate?
Amanda Maness
 Yeah. And like I said, we do have a YouTube channel. There's some things that we talk about on there that say new stuff we're doing or whatever. And then on ADP is our current payroll provider. And they have a home page that each employee sees when they log in to look at their pay stubs and stuff that. And we have a ton of information on there that we're always putting in and taking out. But the scenario that I gave you in the whole extra hours work at the arts festival, we don't put stuff on there like that because we're only looking for somebody to work. That's only a two week lead time. You see what I mean?
[crosstalk 00:31:50] So we do communicate with them. It's just certain things is stuff they need to know, once a year for tax prep or only if there's some extra work available. Because, otherwise, in open enrollment, it's really hard because we have to physically touch each employee. The management is just keeping the rod hot, going from account to account, to account. And then we check and make sure that every person has been spoken with and that thing. And then we have a follow-up list after that. But we can't treat everything open enrollment and put that much manpower behind it. You see what I mean?
Abby
 Yeah. For sure. Great. All right. Do you mind if we run long, Amanda? Do you have another 15 minutes? Can you go until 2:30?
Amanda Maness
 Yeah.
Abby
 [crosstalk 00:32:48] Okay, great. I'm going to speed through some of these then. What technology software and apps do you use to run your business? What are those top three features of those solutions that you use?
Amanda Maness
 ADP is the payroll ePay systems, is time and attendance. The main thing with time and attendance is we need both mobile app capability and phone ability like landline. A lot of our people clock in from landlines because they work in remote areas where the signal's really bad or it's a mechanism of accountability. We know if they're calling from the certain phone number that they're physically in the account versus the mobile app. You have to police the geofencing on that a little bit. And again, with management being stressed out and spread thin, it's hard for them to keep on top of managing the geofencing alerts, I would say. That limits our list of capable or able time and attendance operators.
And gosh! Let's see. We also use the inspection software that I told you about. We use AssetTiger to track all of our assets like where is this floor machine? Is it in inventory at the main headquarter office? Or has it been loaned out to account A or B and how long has it been there? We use AssetTiger for that. We use MaaS360, M-A-A-S360. That is our mobile device management software. So we can send out certain apps or links or documents to any of our devices. For instance, if we get a new piece of equipment and it has a new quick start guide or maintenance guide and a PDF format, we can actually directly send that out to all the devices and it will live on their home screen or in their files. And so that way everybody has access to the latest and greatest. We can really control what it looks like, what it appears. And that's really cool. That was a huge time saver for us as we were growing. Our business grew by about 40% back in 2017 and implementing that MaaS360 was a lifesaver.
And I talked about the inspection app. Another one that we heavily use is called Zoho, Z-O-H-O. And they have a lot of products, but the main one we used is Zoho Forms and Zoho Reports. And basically, we can make any fillable form at all that we would like to. And then we push that form to the apps. I'm on my iPhone right now. So we have forms for trainings or if they're going to upsell a customer, they can create the invoice right there, they can say, all right, we're going to do an extra carpet work and it's this many square feet or whatever. And it automatically submits and we can run reports off all of that. And I would say we have probably 25 total forms across the organization. Now, each supervisor or manager maybe only use about five or six of those, but I'm saying we have 25 total.
If there's an incident to report, whether it be disciplinary or something like that, we have an incident form and that all is kept in a database. We can run reports off of that and look at that and open and close things, separation, termination, vacation requests, all that stuff exists in Zoho Forms. It is very, very powerful. I was going to tell you that if you're building something, you would need to be able to have your users be able to make their own forms and report on them because it has just been in valuable to us being able to gather very quick and specific information regarding a certain subject matter.
And then that is then sent. We can control who that gets sent to, who can see the database, who can get the reports and all that. That way, me as a project manager, I'm not getting the disciplinary notices, because those are routed somewhere else. You see what I mean? Being able to control all of that has been really, really invaluable because if we don't make that easy within a few clicks on their device, they're unlikely to be able to do that as they're busy throughout the day. Having that be at the ready, has been really invaluable for us.
Abby
 Great. As far as business management software, Amanda, do you guys use CleanTelligent or different software? And does that come from ServiceMaster or is it something that you are-
Amanda Maness
 We use clean? We use CleanTelligent. It doesn't come from ServiceMaster. We have a separate contract with them, but we get a discount because of the whole ServiceMaster relationship with CleanTelligent. And I think ServiceMaster, they have a way that they can run reports on franchises that use CleanTelligent. I'm not exactly sure what they can see and can't see, I just assume they can see everything. We don't that, actually. That's another reason that we want to migrate to something that works better and is more of a... What'd you say? Is more of an independent thing that will be sourced [inaudible 00:39:19].
Abby
 And that inspection software that you mentioned earlier, you aren't onboarded with it yet. Could you share what that is or?
Amanda Maness
 It's CompuClean, which is produced by Spartan Chemical, And you can only get it if you are a Spartan Chemical customer, and you have to be a certain level of customer with them. You have to buy a certain level of product with them to have access it. And the reason that is because they're really not a software company, but they built this software. And so it's like a bonus that they give to their customers and it's really, really inexpensive. And I think they did what you're doing now. They did a lot of polling to understand what people would want and they built it. So it's smart on their end because it would keep people buying their chemicals because they have this cost effective inspection software. And by chemicals I mean, cleaning chemicals, floor wax, or floor finish and floor stripper to strip the stuff off of the floor, that kind of thing.
Abby
 Great. I guess we can talk about all these solutions together, but what are the top three features of the current tech stack, the range of solutions that you're using now, what are the top three things that you like about the solutions that you use?
Amanda Maness
 I would say we have control over how they're set up. We can control the hierarchy of them. We can run reports and do analytics on them. Whether that's a budget versus actual report in our time and attendance system, or other types of analytics that we run, we're able to do that very easily in several of them. Like our time in attendance system, a manager can actually click on their account and see their actual versus budget for up to the previous 90 days. And they can talk with the owners about why their accounts performing well or poorly.
And even, it's not just tabular, it graphs it for them so that they can see a visual. And that's really, really cool. Same thing with their labor hours and labor dollars. It creates that for them as well. That's good. And then the fact, like I said, with the inspection software and other stuff that we can control the hierarchy of what's assigned to who. If a supervisor does an inspection of this account, this manager and this director may need to see it. And so we can assign all of those cob webs of permissions, if you will, because sometimes multiple people need to be able to see the data produced by a supervisor or a manager.
So having control over that, the Zoho thing, having control over what data that we gather from... We've even done employee surveys on that thing. We've created an employee survey where they rate this one to five or tick this box or yes or no. And we even have them give their device to the employees to complete an employee survey on that. It's just the applications and what we can use that for is really, really vast. And that makes it very, very valuable to us. So it's the analytics piece, giving the managers or the management level a quick and dirty solution to see the analytics piece. They're not going to download something to Excel and graph it up. Can they see that how one account is performing or click on these three accounts because those three accounts are actually one customer and see how they're all performing as a group or individually? That's very helpful to do.
Abby
 Great. And what do you not about the solutions that you use, Amanda?
Amanda Maness
 I see that you asked this whole integrations' thing and I'm sorry, I'm a project manager so I think very [crosstalk 00:44:10].
Abby
 No, no, no, thank you.
Amanda Maness
 ... Oriented, because I know I'm giving you a lot of answers and I'm switching in between stuff that we do. The integrations, this is a pain point for everybody because there's a lot of people that say, ""We have an open API, everything's great."" But then when small businesses like us, we looked into building an API to hook up ePay, which is our time and attendance and ADP, it is super expensive to do that. And so I appreciate that they have an API framework, but in order to find a company that specializes in that, which we do not and build that for us, I think we got a $20,000 quote one time. And then, of course, you have to pay ongoing so that as both of those softwares update and make changes that you haven't severed your handshake between those two softwares.
The integration is really painful and the HRS and payroll company that I was telling you about, they have one of the most reasonable API integration prices I've ever heard of. And it's like $100 or $125 a month, after you do that to keep it going, which is one of the reasons they're so attractive to us. That whole integration thing, it's just, I've found that, that's a buzzword that people use. But if you talk about really how to put that in practice in your business, it gets really expensive, really fast because it's multi-layered and multifaceted. That's one of the things that I don't like about them.
What do I not about this solutions that you use? I guess we have made a practice to partner with people that are being innovative. For instance, even ePay is constantly rolling out new stuff. Like, hey, this operates this way, it operates better now. And so they'll update it. CleanTelligent has done a really, really poor job of that. They have not changed the way that it works in a significant way, the entire time that I've been here. I guess what I don't like is when I don't see the owners of the app or the solution or the software or whatever you want to call it, being innovative and making changes. Even ADP, there's stuff that I'll find out, man, this operates so much easier now. That was such a pain before. I'm so glad they built this into it. I never sent them an email or filled out one survey about it, but I'm sure they did some customer touches or surveys to understand that building this tool or capability into their software would help people. And so to see that come is really cool.
And we only want to partner with people going forward that can show us that they've been innovative and have taken their customers input and built additional tools and capabilities into their software. Because if you're not already doing that, the possibility of you just starting to do that next year or something is very low. And I know that we left a time and attendance company before I was here, which was over five years ago.
We actually left them because they hadn't changed their stuff at all and several years. And they wanted to go with somebody that was, ""Hey, we don't have this reporting thing at 100% of what we want it to be, but we've built these three things in it this year."" And next year we're going to do these things and show us, what do they call it? The roadmap. Their roadmap of by 2022, second quarter, we plan to roll this out. You see what I mean? And we understand that they have been innovative and they are remaining to be innovative and they're sharing with us what their goals are of building into their applications or software are, so that we understand what's coming and that they're constantly investing and making it better.
Abby
 That's great. Are there any features you'd consider switching software for?
Amanda Maness
 The low cost in API. For instance, I think the HRS and payroll company that I was talking with you about earlier, they were going to charge us $2,000 to make the API between them and the ePay systems, which is our time and attendance. And then it was going to be a little bit over 100 to keep that handshake going. And that to us is very reasonable. So we would switch to people that didn't just say, I have an open API, but they have a cost effective solution to integrate their software with. Everything that we use, we're not using this weird off the beaten path kind of thing. I love the fact that they have integrated with ePay before and they already have solutions built and that it's cost effective for a small business like us, because for us to do that on the open market is just really, really cost prohibitive, especially for a small custodial, janitorial business. If we switched to anybody, it would be so that we can integrate and that it's a cost effective integration.
Also, something for synergies. Right? And that's one of those things where I know with what you guys are doing, it's maybe you're building the costing piece into the inspection piece, into a scheduling piece or a CRM. Do what I mean? Anytime you can streamline those into one system that you don't have to build integrations for, that's always the win. It's just, we found that when we list our business requirements out, that there's a few key things that may be missing from each of these providers. And so that's what has landed us to being more diversified in that regard. That's why when you talk to me about, integrations would be my number one thing, because I know that I want these things, these different systems or softwares or apps to talk to each other because I haven't found a comprehensive solution that meets all of our needs. Even if it met three or four of our needs, that'd be super cool. But I haven't found that yet.
Abby
 All right. Great. We're coming up on time here. Kim, do you have anything that you want to get answered [inaudible 00:51:48]?
Kim
 I don't have any musts, if you want to do just a couple of quick examples of things that made your current software clunky. I know you mentioned that the whole not innovating and it seeming a little bit old. But I was just curious if there were any specifics of things that you've had a hard time doing, or just ways that it is clunky right now?
Amanda Maness
 I would say clunky, because we're in the whole export. I don't know, as we hire new people and they go into our payroll system, we have to export them out of that and then make a couple of changes to that file of whether it be five or 10 employees or whatever, and then upload them to this. And then we also have to upload them to the learning management system. Do you see what I mean? We're having these, it's like a download data clean up or whatever, because it's got to be in this format to go to ePay and this format to go here. And so that is, as much as we've tried to streamline that you, can miss somebody or as we terminate employees, now you've got to go run a separate file to get the people out of the time and attendance system and out of this.
And so that's clunky because we don't have integrations for it. In our inspection software, we can't set rules of, hey, if this account has performed below 90% for 90 days send an email to this. You know what I mean? We can't make rules like that, which would be nice, and the reason that we need that is because their analytics and dashboards suck. It's like we need one or the other because that's the oversight piece. Because a lot of your other questions are around customer satisfaction, your customers are going to be satisfied if you're doing what you said you were going to do. And you can only prove that by making sure that certain accounts are inspected at the frequency they're supposed to be inspected at.
That's my main thing with CleanTelligent is I can't set this account to be inspected every two weeks and these other five to be inspected every month. Do what I mean? I have to run all these reports with the frequency box and then sort, and all that stuff to find out, who hasn't been inspected and the time they're supposed to be inspected in. And it's not sending a reminder to the management. It's up to us to herd the cats to go do that. So having those capabilities built into something where it makes it easier to check up on things. Do you guys use Salesforce or Pipeline or what do you guys use in your sales process? Pipedrive?
Kim
 HubSpot, we use HubSpot.
Amanda Maness
 HubSpot? Okay.
Kim
 Yeah.
Amanda Maness
 Well, isn't it cool how you can check in there to remind you to follow up with this lead in a certain amount of time and you have all your notes there. You know what's going on with that lead. We need that kind of thing to keep our customers happy and to make sure that we are continuing to provide what it is they've hired us to do because we can use that data. If a job or client has become unprofitable, we could actually share some version of that with them and say, ""Hey, we inspect your account every month and it's been performing here and you haven't had any complaints, but in order to keep you and us successful, we need to up the contract price because we're trying to keep people in here and we haven't been able to hire anybody to fill this position or whatever.""
We would love to able to have more control over that and see those... I mean, as many rules as we can set within [inaudible 00:56:19] inspection software is great because we can then use that as a tool to re-approach our customers later on and share a snippet of that with them, because that essentially is the proof of how that account has been serviced over the longevity of how long we've had it.
Abby
 That's great. Thanks, Amanda. If there's anything else or you have any additional notes, feel free to share with us here, if you want to email me anything else. But I don't want to hold you if you-
Amanda Maness
 [crosstalk 00:57:05] Yeah. I'm passionate about people trying to build things that work for their end users. I've done some UX stuff myself through a design thinking deal. And although I'm not a software designer, I think it's great that you guys are thinking along this line. And that's probably why I tried to be a little bit more wordy or make sure and be specific in the examples that I gave, because that's the best way for me to impart to you my little piece. I think that, that's great that you're doing it.
And although I wasn't able to participate on a lot of, I believe, it was Jason's stuff that he was doing, he had a group of people from the industry that he was doing monthly stuff with. I only made it to a few of those, but I try to do that same thing with him. I think it's great that you're doing that because the more efficient and streamlined and user control you can build into your offerings, it just makes it that much more attractive because a lot of us do run pretty lean and mean. For us to be able to set certain things, to operate a certain way and then just let it go and not constantly manage it or download things and build this graph so that we can make decisions or whatever, that is very helpful.
Abby
 Fantastic. Well, thanks so much for your time, Amanda. I'll be in touch for the follow-up. And yeah, thank you for chatting with us.
Amanda Maness
 Sure. No problem. I'm happy to do this another time in the future, if you need that. I'm sure you get a lot of nos, so I'm happy to be a yes for you.
Abby
 We really, really appreciate that. Thank you.
Amanda Maness
 Yeah. I'm sure you get a lot of no's so I'm passionate about that thing. So I'm happy to help in any way I can.
Abby
 Fantastic. Thanks so much, Amanda.
Amanda Maness
 Yeah. Nice talking to you today.
Kim
 [inaudible 00:59:20], Amanda. [crosstalk 00:59:21] Bye.

 Wait, hold on one second. So, John is in charge of the janitorial and porter divisions and then I didn't bring Alejandro who he's like the interim division manager for landscape, but Brisa, she's kind of our in between to multiple roles, branch admin going into our Aspire systems coordinator. So, she's in a unique role where she knows a lot about the landscape janitorial and the other services that we utilize the platform for. And, then Roger is our controller and then Jazmin's also the accounting supervisor. And so, I could have brought a lot of other people that I have to talk to, but I wanted to just... Everybody here is doing, I guess, a lot of cross-functional things with the platform that I think amongst all of us we'll be able to give you all the answers to your questions for the most part.
Abby Hart
 Fantastic, great. I'm going to skip through the customer mix, service mix revenue and that kind of thing just because I feel like you can probably easily answer that via email, but can we chat a little bit about how the company has grown in recent years and if you can draw any lines between that growth and your partnership with Aspire?
David Herrera
 Well, I guess you can draw your own conclusions as to whether it was Aspire or just a confluence of events. It predated COVID, but I guess the luck of the draw was that it happened during COVID that we were embarking upon the need to get out of the prior program, really two programs that we were in. The first one being... I've erased them both from my memory because they're just awful, but prior to Aspire, we had ServiceLedger for a very short time and we were getting out of... What was the other one, guys?
Roger Sur
 FieldOne.
David Herrera
 FieldOne, which we had for probably seven plus years and it was decent, but we kind of had a feeling after five or so that it was probably going to not fit our needs. So, we had put off probably shopping it around, but then it became an issue and this was not too far before, I think it was... I'm just going to throw out a number. I think it was 2018, that things started going a little crazy with just some of the database getting too big.
So, we at that point decided we need to go shopping for a solution that was going to be a single platform for all of our CRM and accounting and operations, et cetera, and of course there's so many out there and meanwhile we're all trying to do our jobs and run a business and so forth. So, that was kind of put on the back burner as a lot of important things are, I think, at the time. And then when push came to shove, we lucked on this one program, ServiceLedger. So, then I went forth with that and it seemed like a decent solution, it turned out it wasn't, meanwhile we had committed to it and started doing the transition to it, and as soon as we made the transfer of data, it pretty much broke our business literally.
So long story short, we transferred everything into it and then we had a lot of personnel change at this time. So our business, it was a mess looking back. That's about the best I can tell you. Personnel wise, even looking back right now, I'm just like, ""What in the hell happened?"" Not just the program, but just everything. It just was a crazy time, I don't understand, it was all pre-COVID. So, I guess in the chaos out of desperation almost, what are we going to do? Well, we've got to get rid of this program. Meanwhile, we're trying to piece back together our business because at the end of the day, this is when... Let's see, I think it was 2019, no, '18. Was that '18 then '19? When was that, Roger, when Terry was there that was the year before COVID?
Roger Sur
 Yeah, it was 2018.
David Herrera
 So, that's when we basically internally could not find and also showed up in our bank account, meaning we couldn't find, there was a shortfall of close to $4 million gone. It's out there, but it was just not collectible, if you will, and on a business that's close to probably 18 million a year. At that time, that's a pretty big number, and so meanwhile our bank accounts, it's in a rough spot and we didn't know that at the time. Then, COVID comes and some people moved on. Roger came aboard and we decide, let's commit to figuring out A, find the money. B, let's get this program in place, meaning yours, and just step by step we got some good people aboard that as I said, number one, we're going to put a platform in place that's going to give our business a backbone of transparency.
Which, it's clear that's what Aspire does, and it also makes people accountable I guess, and it's not that there was nothing untoward that happened with that 4 million. We found it all. What happened, long story short, again, was the other program, it just didn't work. It was literally broken. It was double billing people, but it wasn't sending invoices out. You name it, it happened, to the degree that we were angering clients, long-term clients of, ""Why are you billing me five times for the same thing? You do that one more time, you're fired,"" that kind of stuff, and that's what happened in many instances.
So, it was a very painful 18 months before things kind of settled down. So, that brought us to finally getting onboarded and it takes a while, but we had a great team. Internally, we committed a ton of people and resources. We hired a two outside consultants that had worked with us in the past to help us renew our business, to help us get working with the Aspire people to get on board, but we committed to do it because we had no choice. Basically, it was either do that or probably run our business into the ground, so it was do or die at that point, but internally it helped that COVID was happening because we weren't growing anyway as a company, nobody really was.
We had some opportunities because of some of the work we did with disinfection, but at the end of the day, things were pretty flat, and we actually dropped a little bit in revenue, but we survived, and again, I think it was helpful that happened because it allowed us to actually focus on how to learn the program and fix a lot of other issues that we had internally with the company as well. So, there's always that silver lining, but I would not want to ever do that ever again.
Abby Hart
 Wow, that is quite the story, David. It sounds like it was really this huge catastrophe that brought you to Aspire. Were there any other solutions that you were evaluating at the time, aside from Aspire? How did you vet the solution that you were going to move to after ServiceLedge?
David Herrera
 I've told this story before, it was the only one. I was going into the office driving and heard an ad on the radio for it. I should be a great story for you guys. I'm listening to the radio and how across the screen it has whoever's being advertised and they'll say, ""1-800, blah, blah, blah."" And, I actually took a screenshot of it as I was driving and took it, bam, and when I listened to it I'm like, ""Wow, this sounds like a perfect platform for us.""
And so, I called right away and so talked to... I forget who the rep was and then I think from him, I think I got turned over to Maggie and then she was going out on leave, but we ended up working with both of them and that's how it started that fast, but it was literally off the radio app because it just sounded exactly like what we needed in the moment. And I'm thinking, ""Well, it sounds like a big company."" I researched it pretty quick and I said, ""It seems pretty legit."" So, that's what pulled me in and that was the extent of it. I saw some of the names that had been using it like... I think it was LandCare and a few others, so for me that was at least sufficient at that point to say let's go to step two.
Abby Hart
 Absolutely. Had you talked to anyone else in the industry, any peer groups or anyone else? Had you done your own research to figure out what the word was on Aspire?
David Herrera
 No, none. Our space is a little interesting. Since we're mid-sized, a lot of companies either have their own platform that they've built, which we were looking at those kinds of options, super expensive and take a long time to get them right, if you can get them right. And, we had tried that prior and just for all the elements that I know it could take, it just seemed not the right way to go. And, I know we have a good IT third party that we use, and so they helped us vet it and they like the OpenAPI that you all have and we figured platforms probably good enough to grow with and seemed that that things are on the growing side with you all.
And. I think we lucked into obviously with ServiceTitan, I think that was just icing on the cake later, but we didn't know that was going to happen. Our options are pretty limited because smaller companies, they're kind of doing what we were doing. They were in the QuickBooks world with five different databases of other kinds of programs and we had to get out of that because that's what we were doing and we needed to condense our world down to ideally one or two things, and that's kind of where we're at.
Abby Hart
 Great. Can John, Jazmin, Roger, Brisa, can you talk to me about the top reasons and the top benefits that you get from using Aspire?
Jazmin Vega
 I can talk about the invoicing aspect. Like David mentioned, with ServiceLedger, it was just the total mess, double billing client. We couldn't update billing addresses correctly with the Aspire it's super easy. If clients want to change it for one month, we can do it, change it right back the following month. Also with our aging, it's so much easier. If a customer wants an account statement, we can easily run reports, show them what they've paid, what's outstanding. So as far as invoicing side, so much better. Of course, we're still learning the system. There's ways to improve it, but as of now, it's a great system.
Abby Hart
 Fantastic.
Brisa Beltran
 I wasn't here doing ServiceLedger, but it's very helpful to be able to change the templates for when we create work orders and having the job description to provide every information to the client. And like Jazmin said, we're still learning the system, but it's a great system to use and a great support from Aspire.
John Salido
 I'd say from the operation standpoint, the simplicity of having easy access to documentation as well as the ability to run financial reports as real time reports, as opposed to waiting for an actual financial report to come out or be generated. We can go in and take a look at all the different reports and see where we're sitting at for our divisions from a revenue standpoint. We can track gains and losses and things of that nature. So on that front, those type of simplicities have really helped us as to where previously the old systems were a little bit more difficult to navigate.
We still have some challenges with my division as opposed to Aspire being more of a landscape-based type of platform. With the janitorial and porter departments, we have services that are done on a daily basis in some circumstances, and so navigating the scheduling and stuff like that can get a little complex and we handle it at our role, which is the service line expert, vision manager role, which it was a little bit simpler for our area managers and our field guys to navigate and utilize those functions, but I'm sure that will come with some training.
Abby Hart
 Fantastic. Can you talk a little bit about what you experienced with the onboarding and the training with Aspire and implementation and all of that? Why don't we start with training and implementation and then talk about support and the ongoing partnership with Aspire? Whoever wants to jump in.
John Salido
 Well, I-
David Herrera
 Let me preface that and then I'll let maybe John or whoever, even Roger... I think the biggest two areas and concerns we have, and they're pretty big right now actually, have to do with payroll, but on the daily clock ins, clock outs and things of that nature, and there's two parts to that. One, we just switched over to Acumatica because that's obviously your preferred partner and that's great. We're literally just doing that as of January 1st, but on the payroll side, California, it's a bear and the clock in, clock out stuff is no joke here. It's very different than most states, and so we're having an issue with just Aspire is not... We're trying to use the full capacity of it and we're not. Something is not right, and so we're actually going to meet with Corey over at Inova today to understand where there's a couple major shortfalls with the ability to clock in and out on site and things of this nature because they're not transferring over to the program and we have to do it manual.
And, that's obviously not what we signed up for and that's a problem because that entails either another third party kind of solution or something like that. So, we'll have to set that aside, but then the other is... I think maybe John's going to go into this part, I won't steal his thunder, but because we use a lot of independent contractors and we're switching to that in-house model, where we're going to probably triple our workforce here pretty quick, it's not the easiest to teach people. So maybe, John, you can go through that a little bit if that's where you were headed.
John Salido
 So, with the janitorial and day porter department, we have or deal with and hire a lot of immigrants who are not computer or tech-savvy, a lot of entry level workers working at the minimum wage or just plus pay areas that really don't have any sense of how to utilize their smartphones other than making phone calls and maybe snapping pictures. And so, we find a lot of challenges where the Aspire Mobile Crew app one is a little bit difficult for them to navigate at times and then it's also fairly glitchy on site. And so, I don't know if there would be a call-in number or something like that that's also offered. One, because we have a lot of direct reports, which means that a porter may just directly report to the site itself, but may not warn us making an investment in a two, $300 phone for that account. Maybe they're there twice a week for two hours or three hours or whatever it is, and so just any ideas on any alternatives other than just the mobile app function.
Abby Hart
 Interesting, I will forward that to our product team because I know that it can be a little glitchy and I know that is one of the top priorities for the first half of this year is to shore up any issues with Aspire Mobile, but this feedback is incredibly helpful. Is there anything else as far as some of the ways that CAM Property Services uses the technology or how you guys partner with your client success manager or anyone else in Aspire?
John Salido
 A big tool for us is the site audit function and the way that we're able to really manipulate the site audits to be sent out the way that we want them sent out. I know David and the team has done a great job with our marketing team in putting whatever it is, discounts that we're offering for the month to add new services or whether it's retained work or extra sales work, but on the operations side, the site audit function has been a huge benefit for us in that regard.
David Herrera
 A couple things. One, I didn't have Matt on the call, he's in charge of sales, but I know, and I think in the past, whoever we spoke with, I can't remember her name right now before you, but I think he mentioned in the CRM piece it leaves a little bit to be desired in terms of some of the... It's pretty basic functionality and we're looking hopefully that you all will be able to upgrade that in the not too distant future. It's just a little clunky I guess, but it gets the job done, but it seems like there could be a little more pizzazz to it, but the other thing, and John mentioned it, and I think it has to do more with Aspire, I think it really is a landscape program, and I think, John, you're having to... I said this to our whole company.
We're so different, I think, than your typical client because our business is not like, ""Well, they're a landscape company,"" and I know a lot of your clients do snow removal and other stuff. We're in California, it's 52 weeks, except for this week, where you're mowing lawns pretty much, but we're doing all the other services, parking lot cleaning, janitorial, day porter, steam cleaning. We have six major service lines. They're all equal for the most part in importance, they're all profit centers. It's not as, I guess, generic for lack of a better term. It's not service neutral I think, and maybe, John, you want to elaborate how it could be a little more, at least in your world, janitorial friendly specific to help you out if possible?
John Salido
 So, one of the main things is janitorial work's done at night and we have a couple of locations where we work across the 24-hour barrier, meaning past midnight. And so, what currently happens is we have an individual that's clocked in today and they're shift takes them until 2:00 or 4:00 AM the next day. And so, what Aspire is doing is clocking out, logging only half their shift for the prior day or the day that they started their shift, and then it actually clocks them out at midnight and then they have to re-clock in one minute into the next day to finish their shift.
And so for timekeeping perspective, that's a challenge. That's been a challenge for us trying to manually manage the timekeeping for janitorial work. Other programs that I've used in the past, you start your shift on a certain day, you're able to calculate those total eight hours for that entire shift because it began on a certain day, so that's one major challenge. Another thing, like I had mentioned previously, is the scheduling function just because we could operate 365 days a year at a certain contract. The scheduling, well, it does allow you to do a 12-month schedule in advance. It just doesn't align like it should, and so there's a lot of manual corrections throughout the entire year to make sure that there's enough work tickets for our contracts for the entire year, so just a lot of managing on that aspect.
Abby Hart
 Are there any other key differences? So, you run six total service lines, is that right? So, are there any major differences in how you have to operate an Aspire between those service lines? I guess we'll start there, I have some follow-ups.
David Herrera
 I don't know, Brisa maybe. You're the one that kind of puts together some of the proposals or maybe John, I don't know, might have a little better sense of... I know we haven't really done kits or we're trying to, but I don't know, do you run any difficulties trying to navigate between the different ones or I don't know, is there a wishlist?
John Salido
 It generally covers across all of our divisions the basics for each division. The meat and bones of our operations, it can cover. It's just getting granular into every single division is where it gets a little bit more tricky and it takes a little bit more time, not only just on you guys, on our end too to I guess customize it because there is a lot of flexibility within Aspire. As David was mentioning, the sales kits and stuff like that. So, it takes a more effort on both of our ends to customize it for divisions, but I think the meat and bones of our operation or the main components of it is pretty well-covered by Aspire. We're able to navigate pretty easily between the different divisions.
Brisa Beltran
 I agree with John.
Abby Hart
 Can you talk a little bit about what the major pain points are as far as technology and the verticals that you service? Just to give me a sense of how you're using technology to combat those challenges, so for example, you mentioned that example with janitorial, John. So, a lot of these services are occurring at night, so it's necessary to have a good sense of where your people are, making sure that they're where they need to be. Can you talk about what your major pain points are on the landscape side and the janitorial side and then your other verticals as well?
John Salido
 One thing I'll bring up is just the regular Aspire app when used out in the field versus the full usage of the website. And so, I know our area managers have tablets that they're able to go out and perform site audits and do things of that nature. And so, when they're trying to do the normal functions of the responsibilities through the app, it's a much more difficult process, as opposed to them actually just pulling up a web browser and actually going into the actual website on their tablet and doing it from that function, but if we can actually have the app more functionable out in the field, that would be removing a big pain point from our operation guys, and that's across all verticals.
Abby Hart
 Let me clarify my question. So, that is great feedback and I will, again, be sure to channel that to products. I'm talking about general challenges you have in the industry as opposed to specific challenges with Aspire, does that make sense? But, that is very helpful feedback. If you could talk about the challenges you're experiencing in landscape and janitorial, and I believe-
David Herrera
 Number one I think is finding labor right now. There's a shortage and that seems to be everybody's number one thing is, where is the labor? So, that's the problem, and the problem with that is the wage inflation. So, you have minimum wage and then you have a premium that is beyond that, which if the client would pay a premium on our fee, which is our normal fee, great, but people don't have endless amounts of money to pay on their commercial rents and so forth. We do commercial, we don't touch residential. So, at the end of the day people are... We can get technical and talk, well, they're in triple net, they can pass it on. Well, at some point people start complaining saying, ""Look, if I'm a donut shop owner, I'm not selling that many donuts anymore, so I can't afford to pay the landscape guys or the sweeping guys,"" or if I'm look at the office vacancy rates and so on and so forth.
We can talk economics all day long and at the end of the day money talks and that's going to be a problem. So, I don't know what's going to happen. That's I think what everybody's not understanding I think down the road here. It's going to be a problem, labor is the number one thing. So, that's really on our mind is just we have to find people, number one. We're trying to get equipment and vehicles, that's another problem. Amazingly, they're difficult to locate. It's getting a little bit easier, but they're just not readily available like they used to be pre-COVID. Getting heavy duty trucks right now is... They're at a premium, so very expensive, and if you can find them, and they're taking a long time to produce the way we need. So, that's an interesting problem.
I don't know, but we're starting to find great people in terms of sales people, business developers, as well as some top management folks are starting to seek us out now. So, there are opportunities to grow the business. So, the bigger problem is if we start selling, how do you backfill and do the work? So, that's the challenge. It's more how do we manage what I foresee as some pretty explosive growth that's coming and that's going to I guess be fun, but crazy all at once.
Abby Hart
 Absolutely. Can you talk about how Aspire helps or how you foresee Aspire or how has Aspire helped you grow and be more profitable and tackle this potential growth that's coming?
David Herrera
 Well, it's allowed us to rip apart all of the complexities of our business. We're looking at our business differently now. We've been in business 36 years, so we used to just look at it from a service line aspect and say, ""Okay, the rain comes from these service lines, period."" Well, we've turned that sideways and now we look at it from an asset perspective. And so now that we've introduced Acumatica, we're going to look at it both ways and say, where's the revenue coming from? Is it coming from shopping centers? Is it coming from industrial?
So, we can look at it in a matrix format, and the good part about our business is we're not leveraged on any one service line or any one asset type. And so, if office stays in the tank for a while, well, maybe we don't put any resources toward that and we commit toward multi-family, industrial, that kind of thing, and we keep utilizing the resources that we can pull out of Aspire, which allows us to really look at our current contracts, which we have... That's what that data analysis allows us to do now is say exactly how many properties do we have, how many clients, how contracts, what's the margin?
We didn't have that before. We couldn't get that data quickly and most importantly, accurately, and that's the best part. And, going back to the earlier story, during COVID we didn't have P&L and that was just an abomination, but we didn't have it for nine months. We were just running blind. I don't even know how we stayed in business for that one year, but now we're getting it quickly and now we can really start to make dynamic moves. I think Jazmin said it, we're still learning the program, so we're very excited as to how quickly and dynamically we're able to make almost real-time business decisions, I think, and we've just barely begun to play around with the program.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Can you talk a little bit about any increases in profitability or any efficiencies that you've been able to achieve with Aspire? I know it's probably night and day, given the disaster you were dealing with before, but if you can talk about if you have any solid metrics we're able to bill or close out the month that we weren't able to do that before or we're able to bill within a week or whatever, if you can talk to any kind of hard metrics or things that you're able to measure since using Aspire.
David Herrera
 Well, I don't have that dashboard in front of me that was just sent to us, Roger. There was some pretty powerful metrics regarding our accounts receivable that we've been tracking, and I'll let you talk to that. Well, why don't start with that? The AR has been just phenomenal now over the last year and a little bit.
Roger Sur
 Well, so if I could add something to it. So before Aspire, basically David didn't get his financial statements towards the end of each month for the prior month. I'm sorry, there's an echo.
Abby Hart
 I can hear you fine, Roger.
Roger Sur
 So with Aspire, it's allowed for me, number one, to pay our subs. Usually we net 45, I got it down 15. It's just the reporting, the efficiencies and the check and balances basically gave me the confidence where I was able to move up some processes. As in the past 12 months, I've been able to provide David P&L no later than the 10th of 12th of each month in comparison to 30 days thereafter. Did I say about receivables? There was that $4 million when I first came on board. It was just insane. So, now our average AR is about $1 million if not less and money is just flowing, compliance, sending out invoices is gone, eliminated. So, it just made basically my life easier and everybody else in the company.
Jazmin Vega
 And if I can add to Roger's with ServiceLedger, vendors would it get paid basically whatever they would invoice us. Now, we know ahead how much they're supposed to invoice. So if it's not matching, we question it, so it's more of a [inaudible 00:40:13].
Roger Sur
 Yes, so check and balance.
Abby Hart
 Awesome, fantastic.
David Herrera
 I did share a metric. We had a town hall meeting the other day, and interestingly, our revenue for the first time, total revenue for CAM and Omnia, our construction arm, since 2007 we had not broke double-digit growth year over year. And so was, I don't remember the exact percentage. I'm bragging and I don't remember it, but it was 12.2... 12% this past year, and the last time we broke 10% was 2007, and that year was 15%. So, it's been a long time since we've grown, and that's coming out of the mess that we were in with COVID, with transitioning through COVID with Aspire, et cetera.
And, we're extremely confident that our account retention rate, which I've been saying for years and years and years is really the key to our success in growth was the best it's been, I don't even know, probably the last five to eight years. We have an attrition rate that we try and attain every year, and last year we finally exceeded it, and that really probably was the basis for not only last year's success, but if we keep that going, that's going to propel us, again, into another terrific growth here, and hopefully we're having even a greater compounded annual growth rate for 2023.
And John alluded to it earlier, we're banking on site audits as our... That's tool to beat the client complaints and attrition rate because that proves that we were there, A. B is it gives our client that sense of, what am I paying for? Well, here's photos to prove it, and secondly, and most importantly, it also gives a chance to provide some opportunities for upsells. So, there is a kind of double benefit there.
Abby Hart
 That's great, that is all very much in line with what we've been hearing from a lot of our clients, David. I did have... Hang on. I guess let's talk from a general perspective how you've been with Aspire since... Hold on, I can... Of course, my HubSpot is not working very well.
Jazmin Vega
 October 2020.
Abby Hart
 I'm sorry, November 2020, Jazmin?
Jazmin Vega
 October 2020.
Abby Hart
 October, perfect. So, you've had quite a bit of time working with Aspire and learning the program, obviously it will take a long time to master everything that the program can do, but can you talk about how you envision the partnership with Aspire kind of moving forward and how you plan on using the technology and the resources to grow your business? If you're trying to maintain the current revenue, how you plan on using it to support that? I'm not sure what your business goals are at the moment.
David Herrera
 Well, internally, our goal is to... Well, now it's one year less, but we're on a five-year plan to double our business, so we're tracking that, and so now we have four years left to do it, but I think we're off to a great start to catch up this year and get back on track with that, last year proved it number one. So that's inspired, now we have the means to do it, but we also have seen the results from what I said. So, people I think are seeing that. And so, they're kind of seeing the cause and effect, I think, so that's a good thing. But what we want to do using Aspire, because I was the firm believer in it and let smarter people actually implement it, but it's add to it. So, we added Acumatica and we're just barely getting our feet wet with that, but I think it's going to be a great tool.
We need to figure out this HR issue with the wage and hour thing because that massively could be a costly thing for us, so we've got to figure that out. I'm sure we will, but the other thing we want to do, because I know Aspire and you all are huge on dashboards, and we're starting to understand how powerful those can be is probably later on this year look at Power BI as an add-on, just to make things easier, to get a little more real-time reporting to people in the field and/or internally. Just to John's point, really try and show people a little bit more of what are you doing and why.
What we try and do is when people come to the office is, why am I going, why should I care? Well, if you can give them the reason for going out to the field, and this is why you need to look up and take an interest in the client's property as if it was your own, you may get paid for that. Well, maybe they will. So, that's why we want to use it that way, and how we would like to continue to partner is I took a pretty large team to the last event in San Antonio, and that's my second IGNITE, but I think your organization's a great organization. I like how you had done that, and I think that's a smart way to share knowledge. I'd like to see our company become a leader within the Aspire group of companies and just be the go-to company of this multiple service group or service industry, service line type provider because I think we're pretty unique. And so, I think that we can add a lot of value. So, that's where I'd like to see us fit into your overall scheme too.
Abby Hart
 Fantastic. Does anyone have any other thoughts on how you work with Aspire and what you're learning in Aspire and how it helps you be better at your job? Oh, John-
Brisa Beltran
 I'm still learning a lot from Aspire, but it does hold me accountable. There's a lot of reports to run to help the team. It's still a lot of resource to learn from Aspire, which I'm excited to do so, and I know there's a lot of new changes are coming in with scheduling, with work tickets, with mobile, knowing when the crew is out, there's just a bunch of resources that I still have to tackle.
Jazmin Vega
 In the accounting side, we are starting to utilize the customer portal, I believe that's what it's called, client portal, where clients are able to go online, create their account, see what's past due, they're able to pay their invoices. We've sent it to a few clients, so far we've gotten good feedback, but hopefully we're able to roll it out completely, and that's something that will definitely help us.
Abby Hart
 Great.
John Salido
 And, I've shared already how it's helped us, hoping to see just some fine-tuning on the operations side, and really excited to see what bears from the relationship that you guys now have with Service Time because I know they're giant in the industry as well.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Thanks, John. Let me think... Oh, David, you're probably the one to summarize it most clearly as the owner, but what are the top three things that you get out of Aspire? They could be features, they could be just general benefits.
David Herrera
 Well, great trips when you put these IGNITEs on. Well, I don't think you can overemphasize the transparency into the business, but also for people internally to look into the business as appropriate, if your business culture is set up that way, which it is here. And so, I think that's important to note because I don't think that every business is set up that way, but this one is, so that's a good thing, number one. Number two is the accountability piece, and that's a huge thing because it goes hand in hand with the prior thing, which our culture that we pride ourselves here is this meritocracy.
You do the work, you get rewarded for the output and the results. And so, that's what we're pushing out there to our folks, and so this allows us to track that. And so, that's a pretty big deal for people that want to work in that kind of culture and workplace and be rewarded for their efforts, and we can track that from day one. And so, that's a great thing and it really gives you that insight, and then I think number three, I don't know, it's I guess reliability of it.
It's given us a peace of mind that I just can't describe it because we were in such shambles to now not being. That's pretty strange and that's a good feeling, but I don't know how we did it, but we did it, but I think it's just this reliability and the team has done a fabulous job, and I don't praise them enough, but thankfully they've embraced it and we almost erased all those years. So, I think that took it out of me, but it's the reliability of it. So, I look forward to better things to come from... Like John said, I think the partnership and all that stuff is going to be super, so I'm glad, I guess, I was tuned into the radio station that day.
Abby Hart
 We're glad too. Now, we know for certain that our radio ads pay off. David... Oh my gosh, I had one... I guess while I figure out what I was going to ask you, we have a little bit of time here. Can you give me the quick rundown of your customer mix, service mix, revenue, and number of employees?
David Herrera
 So, number of employees is a 100, basically. Currently it's about 40 in the office upfront, meaning sales, operations, administrative. The rest are split amongst the different service lines, mostly in day porter and landscape and steam clean. And you're saying, ""Well, how do you do all your business?"" Well then, like I said before, it's with these independent contractors, but we have to get out of that business. This part, I don't want that... Because California can't do that anymore, and so we need to convert our model to self-perform. And so, we anticipate by year-end being close to 300 employees total. So, we're going from managing contracts to managing people, and that's going to be the challenge as well. So labor is a challenge, finding people, but also as a management mindset, that's going to be one of the challenges we have.
But in terms of our service mix, our day porter is our largest service line, and in our case, day porters do outdoor shopping centers for the most part, but they also can do, depending on if it's a multi-family, sometimes they call them day porters or an office building sometimes will call them day porters, so there's a little bit of a mix there. And then it's landscape, and I'm giving you how it goes, so day porter, landscape sweeping, steam cleaning, janitorial, and then repair and maintenance, that's descending order of revenue.
I don't know if you want specific numbers, I could give you that, but in terms of the mix, it's about 31% for day porter, and that's the largest one. Landscape and sweeper, 22 and 20%, this is of our business, and then steam cleaning is 13, janitorial is 12, and repair and maintenance is 1%, and that's just our hourly facility type guys. My asset class, our largest is shopping centers, and that's 41% of our revenue, and that's starting to reduce, which is good just because we used to be predominantly that.
At one point it was 100% of our business, but over the years the mix is changing. The next largest is retail chains, and so that would be your grocers, pharmacy types, that kind of thing, that's 27%, and then office is 12%, multi-family is eight, government is six, and industrial is 5%. And so the two growth, well, three growth areas that we really see would be industrial, multi-family, and the retail chains. Those are three that we really want to go after in the coming years. There's big contracts there that utilize us currently, but we're trying to refocus our sales efforts into those three areas.
Abby Hart
 Fantastic. We're coming up on time, and I want to be respectful of your time. If you have five more minutes, David, Roger, and anyone else who wants to stay on, that would be great. I just have a couple... One major question, I guess. So, you mentioned... If anyone has to drop off, please go ahead and do so, and thank you all for your time. Is it all right to stay on for just a few more, David?
David Herrera
 Yeah, I've got a couple minutes.
Abby Hart
 Great. You mentioned that you plan on increasing to 300 employees. 300 employees by the end of this year, and then doubling your current revenue in five years. What's the current revenue?
David Herrera
 We did just under 20.
Abby Hart
 Just under 20, great.
David Herrera
 This last year.
Abby Hart
 How do you foresee Aspire helping with those growth goals? Now that you're turning to managing people and doubling revenue, those are pretty serious goals, so what's your philosophy on how you can use tech to do those things?
David Herrera
 So, the account retention is pretty much the most important piece of that because our base of revenue is if we can count on basically keeping what we sell every year, or at least having what we go into in the new year, that's a big deal. So, not losing accounts allows us to forecast like I think any other company in our space. Even though they're annual contracts, they're really only good for 30 days, but typically people are pretty loyal. So, it allows us to forecast at least for a year, if not a little bit longer.
And then our sales team, we're adding a team of reps based on the asset class, not by service line, but by asset class, and so we see the growth, that's the bet we're making. And, based on past performance and what we see as the need out there, if we can combine the new contracts with that account retention, plus the historical tag work or extra work that comes with it, the growth should be there and revenue, and then we have, of course Omnia, the construction company that is still... We're actually in the midst of a rebrand there, and I think conservatively we're not looking for that to double, triple in size, but I think it's going to be another great identity, and add-on that will work symbiotically very well with CAM and vice versa. So, we're pretty excited for both brands going forward.
Abby Hart
 Fantastic. All right, I really appreciate all of your time. Thank you for giving me some feedback on where we're falling short and where we're able to help you grow your business. I'm going to draft what I've got. I may have some follow-up questions, so if you could look out for those via email. I don't know if you have a marketing person, David, if you could have them send headshots and maybe some project photos or photos of folks working, that would be great, but I really appreciate your time. Thank you so much for being so candid with me and for being patient with all of my questions. Thanks again.
David Herrera
 You bet, thank you.
Abby Hart
 Thank you, goodbye, everybody.
Brisa Beltran
 Thank you, Abby. Bye.

 Austin. Yeah, we are recording now. How long have you been with Crew Control?
Austin Hurst
 Let's see, we would've started with Crew Control probably early... Gosh, I think it was 2020 is when we started with Crew Control, early 2020.
Abby Hart
 Great. What were you using prior to Crew Control [crosstalk 00:00:30]?
Austin Hurst
 So we've always used QuickBooks, but that was a lot of estimating and stuff, but obviously billing. Before that we were just using some route optimization software and then honestly, just a lot of your generic pen and paper. I mean, we were small enough at that point where we could get away with it.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. What route optimization software were you using?
Austin Hurst
 Oh, man. Can't remember what it was called. It was just something pretty basic where I think we could route 10 jobs for free. Well, we could see, it was an app... let's see if I still had the app on my phone. I think it was this Route4Me.
Abby Hart
 Okay. [crosstalk 00:01:29]
Austin Hurst
 It was just something very basic.
Abby Hart
 Great. And how big is your company, Austin?
Austin Hurst
 In terms of revenue or employees, or both?
Abby Hart
 Both if possible.
Austin Hurst
 So last year for revenue, we were about 1.3 million. And then employees now, as of March 1, we'll have 11 full-time employees. Right now we've got nine, we're hiring two as of March 1 of this year. And then with our seasonal guys, we'll get up to about... Last year we were at about 21 guys total during our peak. This year, we'll probably be about the same, maybe get closer to 23, 24.
Abby Hart
 How many crews are you running with Crew Control?
Austin Hurst
 I was actually talking to David about this the other day, so it just really fluctuates for us. We're in Iowa so obviously we deal with the winter. So we're not running as nearly as many crews during the winter, just because it's such a slow time of year. So right now, I mean honestly, when we're not in an active snowstorm, we're running about two crews. But when we have an active snowstorm going on, we actually also use Crew Control for some of our subcontractors as well, and just dispatch that to them. So during our peak for snow season, we're probably at about six or seven crews if we have an active snowstorm.
And then during our peak season we'll have... So last year we had two mowing and crews. Essentially, we ran two landscaping crews and then we just had a, we call it a quality control crew that goes around and just... it's almost the maintenance crew, make sure landscaping beds look good, all that stuff. So we pretty much plan on having all those again and then maybe an additional mowing crew and then also a full-time fertilizer crew as well.
Abby Hart
 Oh, wow. Okay, great. What would you say is your... Are you all residential or do you do some commercial properties? What's your customer mix?
Austin Hurst
 So we pretty much, I would say it's probably about 70/30. 70% commercial and HOA, stuff like that, then 30% residential. As we continue going, we hope to continue to stretch that number closer to... I mean, we'd to do all commercial and HOA and apartment complexes, that type of stuff, and get away from the residential. But we're probably 70/30 right now.
Abby Hart
 Perfect. What's your mix as far as surfaces go? Looks like you've got a full service.
Austin Hurst
 Yep. So obviously, and I'll do my best to put percentages on it, but our main services that we offer would be yawn mowing, fertilizing, irrigation, I'd even say tree work, and then landscaping and then snow removal. I would say probably-
Abby Hart
 Is that landscape construction?
Austin Hurst
 Yep. Landscaping construction. Something we started doing, which throws a little bit of a mix in our services and how it's all broken down is we've started to do annual service contracts, so those just bundle everything. So we essentially just made that its own category, just because it's difficult where it's, okay, before we were doing six months it was snow and then six months it was mowing. Well, you we've actually got trimming trees and fertilizing and all stuff bundled into the contract for a flat monthly rate. So it's not really technically mowing for those six months and it's also not technically snow for those six months.
So we started to make that a thing as well, just because I guess long story short, our business model, what we plan for and aim for is we try to get a lot of these monthly contracts just because obviously you're able to build that money up front. So the same thing too, we're going towards, where because sometimes people don't want to sign for the whole year. So we've also started to change it, for if we get essentially a lawn care contract that might include mowing, fertilizing, all that stuff, we'll just categorize it under lawn care, instead of specifically mowing or fertilizing, just because all those services are technically bundled into that one monthly rate, if that makes any sense.
Abby Hart
 That makes sense.
Austin Hurst
 But I mean, if you take out account of that and just throw in our main services, I would probably say mowing is probably about 30% of our revenue. I'd say landscaping's probably 35 to 40%. These are obviously all off the cuff too, without looking up the hard numbers. I'd say snow removal after the that's probably about 20%. I will say it's hard because, and I've talked to David about this too, it's actually our first year doing fertilizer internally. So that's why our fertilizer numbers are so low. This is based off of what we did last year. So obviously we expect our fertilizer numbers to be way higher, but one of the guys that's starting March 1 is going to be our full-time fertilizer guy. So that's why all the numbers probably don't really make [crosstalk 00:08:17] sense, but-
Abby Hart
 Totally fine, I get it.
Austin Hurst
 But then that last 10% would be your fertilizer, irrigation and tree work, to be honest.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. Perfect. You got to start somewhere.
Austin Hurst
 Yeah. Oh, absolutely. And we get all these calls and stuff for fertilizer and we're already there most of the time mowing, so we were just like, ""We got to find somebody can do this because we're just wasting too much money.""
Abby Hart
 Yeah. I mean, it's an undertaking, especially to get under your belt as well. I mean having [crosstalk 00:08:52] having a certified guy and [crosstalk 00:08:56] different animal than pushing a mower.
Austin Hurst
 Exactly. Absolutely. [crosstalk 00:09:01] Definitely a learning curve.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. For sure. [crosstalk 00:09:03]
Austin Hurst
 For sure.
Abby Hart
 All right, Austin. So I guess describe a day in the life of your company now. With this question I guess I just want to get a sense of... And this could be prior to Crew Control and then after Crew Control or I guess you could just describe what it is that you love about what you do, why you do it. And talk about your team and your culture. I mean, your sort of open interpretation.
Austin Hurst
 Yeah, yeah. No, absolutely. So I mean, obviously I'm fortunate to be in the situation I am for sure. So our company was started by, it was actually a guy that I went to high school with. I've known him for a long, long time. And so he started it back in 2015 and so that was in the same time where I was in college. So I actually would help work with him during the summers. There would be times where I'd come, when I'd gotten over with class and everything. During the school year I'd come help him out, just on a part-time basis. And then he obviously just had the vision of wanting to take it bigger.
I actually went and worked a different job out of college. We continued to stay in touch, I'd help him as much as I could. And then he just offered me, wanted me to come on full-time. He's just a very, very skilled worker with his hands out in the field doing that type of stuff. I mean, I went to college for business management. So behind the computer, running numbers, that's my niche and where I'm comfortable. So it was just a natural fit for both of us. So back in 2018, that's when I came on, that's when I started. So that's just a background of how I ended up here.
Why I love it so much, it's just the familiarity, obviously I knew him, had a friendship with him in the past. So back in 2018, it was just Jake and myself, and we actually just identified... we had a guy that we went to high school with as well, that was actually working for another company in the same industry. We approached him, wanted him to come over, pretty much take over our mowing department, pretty much run that. Ended up getting him over and just from there started continuing to stockpile guys either that we knew or essentially came recommended to us by somebody else. And that's how we build out our full-time guys. So just little bit of background there. We just have a great culture of guys just because we do have the familiarity of some of the guys I have known in the past and knew they would be good fits, and then other guys we brought in have been recommended by other full-time guys that are currently here that they knew would fit. So that'd be where I'd first start.
About a day in the life of Latitude 41 would be, I think we've got really, really good people and we've made an emphasis on just wanting to bring in the right people to build this thing the right way. We want to continue to grow this thing and we know that we're capable of it. I mean, just looking from when we started, when I started with Jake back in 2018, I think we did about $390,000 in revenue that year and just he and I. We were working out of his garage and now we've got an actual shop. We've got nine full-time guys, it's going to be 11 in March, and we know we're capable of growing it.
I mean, the biggest things are people. The thing that I loved, the reason why I'm passionate about it from a day to day standpoint is that's the first thing, just getting to do something I'm passionate about that I really enjoy with people that I enjoy doing it with. I know that we've got really good guys that care about this and see the same vision as us, wanting to work hard now to grow this thing. So that's been fun. And then also just continuing to see the growth and adding different crews. We're planning on having two mowing crews this year, potentially a third, if there's a demand for, and if we can hire the guys. We're going to have a full landscaping crew, and now we'll have an internal fertilizer crew, which is something we've never had before. So that's definitely exciting.
It's always fun as well when we get the seasonal guys in during the summer, just because we're at full capacity, full go, there's a ton work going on. And it's also fun too, just because we've also brought in guys that have taken accountability and responsibility and every department we have is self-sufficient. These guys come in, they know what they're doing every day. I mean, it's not like Jake or myself we're having to micromanage tell them what to do. I mean, using Crew Control especially, these guys come in... We've got a company laptop out in our shop area. Our crew leads will come in, it's pretty much, obviously they have access to the administrator side of Crew Control and those guys are able to see what jobs are there, what jobs are already scheduled, if they need something else to put on there. It's very obviously user friendly that they can utilize it, drag, click, everything that they need to do.
So that's been fun too, just seeing those guys continue to take personal growth and more accountability and responsibility running their own departments within our business. Whether it's mowing, landscaping, irrigation, fertilizer, et cetera. And Crew Control's been a huge part of that. So probably a little bit of rambling there for a bit, but that would be, I guess how I would describe a typical day at Latitude. Those guys will come in and do that and then go on their way. And then everybody funnels back in at the end of the day and we're out of here and we'd do it again the next day.
Abby Hart
 That's awesome. Sounds like you guys were really building something great over there at Latitude 41. So you mentioned while you were in college, and after you came out, you worked somewhere else.
Austin Hurst
 Yes.
Abby Hart
 What were you doing after college, Austin?
Austin Hurst
 So I actually took a job with Wells Fargo out of college. I was working in the post reconciliation of loans, typically they're mortgages. So it was just a lot of numbers, fee reconciliation, making sure that all the fees were charged accurately to the borrower and just a lot of numbers. And that's the thing with me as well, I mean, took the job, great experience, loved my boss, loved everything I did there. Obviously the money was good coming out of college. It was just, I mean, I kept talking to Jake and obviously we were both nervous because we didn't know what it would look like if I came over and was doing business things all day every day, which obviously that's not how it started, but I was doing a lot of work in the field of him to begin with.
I think just for me and I guess why I made the switch was I realized and came to a point where I just felt, and it wasn't anything that anybody did, it was just more the situation that I was in, I really just felt a number. And I just knew if I got up and left the next day that I'd just be replaced at Wells Fargo. I just wanted more of that personal satisfaction in my career of wanting to be, even if I was just a bigger part of something small, I wanted to have the rewarding of seeing something grow.
If I would've stuck it out at Wells Fargo, there would've eventually been positions for advancement and move up. But at the same time, I was going to be doing the same thing every single day. And that was another thing too, where I like with what I do right now, there's always seems to be a little bit of a different challenge each day with what I'm doing. So that's something as well that I enjoy, just the fluctuation of not every one day is the same, and just also being able to be a part of it and take pride in growing this. Essentially this business is all on our shoulders, so that's something that I enjoy and gets me out of bed too, for sure.
Abby Hart
 That's great. So since you've been at Latitude 41, what do you think have been your most significant accomplishments? I mean, and this could be for you and Jake together, since you guys are growing the business together. And what are some of your most significant challenges?
Austin Hurst
 So significant accomplishments. I would say number one, being able to buy the shop that we're in. We actually don't lease the space, we actually purchased it. We're a little bit outside of town, but it's actually a shop that's on 24 acres and we are able to purchase that. So that's just huge for the business as well because we see ourselves being here long term, for sure. We've got a lot of room to grow on the space that we're on. So that was definitely a huge accomplishment, especially just starting out of his garage and doing what we could to get by, to save money, to essentially make something this happen. That'd be number one.
Number two, I would honestly say probably just hiring the guys that we have, to be completely honest, especially these full-time guys. We just have a great, great group of guys, they have a lot of the same personality traits as we do. Everybody's hungry, everybody wants this thing to grow. Everybody's passionate about it. They're invested in what we're doing. And just seeing those guys, the personal accountability and responsibility that they're taking to grow this thing with us, it just really is we're all invested in this and we're all passionate about it and we're all aligned in terms of how we see this thing growing and doing things the right way, stuff like that. So that's definitely a big accomplishment too, something that I'm proud of.
And then I would say as well, probably just from a personal standpoint, hitting a million dollars this last year, that's always been a goal of mine. That's something last year that we did. Let's see, last year 2021, we did about $790,000 in sales. I'm sorry, 2020, we did about $790,000 in sales. And so in the beginning of 2021, my personal goal for the business was to hit a million dollars in sales. I view it too as that's just a complete success by everybody on the team, because you got to have guys that can sell the product and get the customers and keep that customer relationship. And then you've also got to have great guys that do the work and do a good job and allow you to capitalize on that. So I'm proud of that for sure, just because it was a combined team effort. And not only that, but we pretty well surpassed it. So that's something that I was pretty proud of as well and just something that I view as just a team accomplishment.
Abby Hart
 That's great. You don't sell, do you, Austin?
Austin Hurst
 Occasionally a little bit if it's somebody that I personally know. I actually used to do pretty much all the sales. We actually hired a guy in our office, Blake, another guy that we went to high school with. He actually was working a different job. We actually hired him, it'd be a year ago in March now. So last year, at the beginning of the year, he had no knowledge of the industry at all. We honestly just identified him just because I've personally known him for a long time and I just know he's very good at talking to people, he has excellent personality skills, social skills, and I know he just also fits the culture and the view of... When I think about sales, it's not trying to essentially sell somebody something that they don't need. It's just essentially presenting them all their options and wanting them to be comfortable with the option they pick and providing that service. So he's done excellent. He's done a great job, continuing to learn.
So last year I did definitely help him out, and I still do occasionally just on the numbers side of things now, just to make sure because we're in an industry where obviously just anybody, all the numbers are changing. Our fertilizer prices are going up about 25, 30% this year. And it's also something new that we have to learn how to quote, just because we've never really done a lot of it before. So I still help on the backside of things, but Blake's entirely front facing the customers and he's taken over that role. I would say probably about late July or early August is when he really started to essentially feel very comfortable in terms of taking that over and not really having me step in anymore.
So yes, long answer to a short question. I'm not really involved in the sales aspect of it anymore. The main area where I am would just be on the back end, making sure that the numbers look good and the pricing is good before it goes out the door. But we've got a pretty good system where Blake keeps the customer mirrored communication intact and reaches out to them, see what they want. And then when they want to quote, he'll actually put all the numbers together and then he just sends it over to me and I just review it before it goes out the door, just essentially double check and work, making sure everything looks all right.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. Great. I'm actually going to combine this challenge, because I do ask about challenges [crosstalk 00:25:13] laid out as well. So let me ask, when did you first become aware that you needed something like Crew Control to run your business, and what were the main challenges you were facing at the time?
Austin Hurst
 I mean, honestly, for me, it was pretty evident right away that we needed something. Even when I first started back in 2018, the biggest thing was we just obviously were a little bit more strapped for cash than we are now. So it was a little bit more of a hurdle in terms of like, ""I'm not really sure that we want to allocate this much money to something."" So that was the first obstacle that I would say. And there was a need right away. We were even doing an up volume where we were putting all this stuff on paper and trying to write on calendars and stuff. And even tried to use Google Calendar on our phones and everything to try to keep track of stuff, and it just got to be too much. And there was stuff where we'd realize two months later that we never build something and that's just obviously not good and not sustainable.
I'd say just even too, piggybacking off of that at, I did do some research at the beginning, just trying to look for something. And I never obviously came across Crew Control. I mean, a lot of the ones that we were looking at and finding and having conversations with, they were catered just for much bigger companies than we were. So they really just didn't make sense for us, whether it was just price or how difficult it was to use, obviously. So that's-
Abby Hart
 I'm sorry to interrupt. So-
Austin Hurst
 No, no, you're good.
Abby Hart
 Billing, cashflow. What other areas of the business were you looking for software to come and help manage?
Austin Hurst
 Definitely billing and cash flow. Honestly, just scheduling too, making sure. Because that was another thing too. And that's another thing that I really love about Crew Control is just being able to schedule that work so you can actually tell how far booked out you are. That was another thing too, where we'd just try to put stuff on this schedule, but we were just essentially typing it down on a Google document or trying to put it in our calendar, but it was just really hard to handle.
And even handling all the leads and stuff that we had and scheduling stuff to go look at projects. That was another thing too, that just got put by the wayside, which obviously now I know group control's developed that sales side of it too, but even just when I was initially having conversations with David and I was talking to him one day and with the picture functionality and just even having crews, I'm like, ""Well, we could really just make an estimating crew and just have everything on there."" Because that was another thing as well, when we were trying to quote stuff, you go out to a property and you're trying to take notes on your phone, trying to take photos. And the photos, you're trying to remember which photos are for what project when you've got thousands of photos on your phone.
And so even just obviously when we got Crew Control, that's another thing that David and I were talking about too, was, ""Hey, this could really be used for quoting these projects as well, just because we can keep all the notes in one customer tab. You can take the photos and associate them with that job. That's obviously something that ended up being huge for us too.
But definitely just like you said, the billing and cash flow aspect of things, making sure when you do get the work done you can bill it. Also remembering what day you did the job, so then when you do bill it, you know you have the accurate date. Even just little things like a lot of times, especially during snow season customer will call you ask when you were there and you can go back and reference it really quick and say, ""Hey, we were there from 1:15 to 2:45 on this day,"" just with the clock in and clock out function. So definitely that.
And then biggest thing I would say is just the scheduling aspect of knowing how far booked out we are, even just knowing how much work we can really take on. That was another thing too, was just knowing like, ""Okay, are we capped out for mowing? How much work can we take on?"" We were always just guessing, but now just being able to estimate how long a property's going to take you, with how many guys, then also accounting for drive time. You can really get down to the hard numbers and figure out are we pretty much capped, can we handle more? And before it was just a guess.
Abby Hart
 That's great. How did you find Crew Control and what made you sign up, Austin? Was there a feature or anything or conversation with David where you were like, ""Oh, we need this more than we need to keep doing the things the way we've been doing them""?
Austin Hurst
 So actually, how I got hooked up with Crew Control and with David was I actually was down in Florida at the Lawn and Landscaping Technology Conference down there. This would've been 2019. I think it was late 2019, and then we would've started with Crew Control, it would've either been late 2019 or early 2020, is when we would've started. So it was actually funny, and David loves this story every time that I remind him of it. So he's actually down there, it was just him and his dad. And so his dad was helping him show the product and everything. And David was talking to somebody else, I was actually talking to his dad and his dad was running me through it. And I could tell he wasn't very comfortable, he didn't know a lot about it. So he was trying to show me on this iPad, how it wore worked and he just kept reminding me like, ""Hey, I apologize. I'm just here helping my son and all this stuff."" And I'm like, ""No, you're totally fine.""
And I told David, I said, ""Either you or your dad is a genius and the best salesman ever."" Just because I could tell that he had had no really familiarity with the product, but he was able to work it and use it. And it just showed me how simple it was. That was a big thing for me too, just at this point we did have more guys and we were going to obviously want to bring on more guys. And I was just like, ""Okay, well.""
Some of the products that I've looked at were just so ridiculously complicated that I was just like, I mean, we're just not at a point with our business where we can really take even a month or two to have a learning curve to have these guys learn this product. Especially I mean, if we did, it would be during this time during the winter, but we'd have to essentially just pray that it doesn't snow. And if it's snowing, we're not going to be able to take the time needed to figure it out. So that was a huge thing too. Just seeing the simplicity of the product, immediately I was interested. Once I figure out the pricing as well, I was like, ""Well, I mean, this is absolutely perfect for something that we're looking for. It's not going to cost us $500 a month. It's something that's very simple, that is feasible for our business.""
So after that actually David's dad gave me David's card. I sent him an email, just said, ""Hey, I spoke to your father at the Lawn and Landscaping Technology Conference, very interested in your product."" From there he set up a call with me going over everything. I thought it was great. Then I brought in, obviously Jake, our owner, we set up another call with David. He showed the product, Jake thought it was great, just was everything that we were looking for. And then from there we signed up and we've been there ever since.
Abby Hart
 That's great. That's such a funny sales story.
Austin Hurst
 Yeah, I know. I remind him of it every time. I'm like, ""Hey, the only reason I'm here working with you is because of your dad. So you better be nice to him.""
Abby Hart
 So let's talk about, you touched on this already, but how has Crew Control changed your business for the better? You mentioned handling leads, scheduling crews. You've talked about creating an estimating crew, so I'm not sure if that's how you're doing estimating now [crosstalk 00:34:33].
Austin Hurst
 Still how we're doing it.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. Associating images, jobs, and understanding your bandwidth. How else has Crew Control sort of reshaped your business?
Austin Hurst
 It's just allowed us to grow for sure. It's a huge, and I even told Dave this too, I mean, it was a big sales tactic in terms of getting this... So actually this fertilizer guy that we're hiring that's starting March 1, he actually has his own business. And he just got a smaller business, he reminds me a lot of Jake when he started his business. Just smaller, trying to figure things out, grow. Hungry, wants to work, younger guy, he's 22.
We actually initially met with him to come over and have him be a subcontractor for us. We wanted to just contract out residential mowing, just because we knew that we wanted to get into fertilizer and that's been our plan the whole way. And we actually just talked to him about contracting out residential mowing, just because we run bigger mowing crews. So mowing residentials internally ourselves doesn't really make sense for us, just because we send four or five guys out on a crew and then we've got to... In mowing a residential, I mean, if you don't get it done in about five minutes, you're probably going to be upside down money wise, and boy, it'll cost you.
So we started to subcontract out those residentials and we actually were just talking to him, and just after we had lunch with him, I told Jake, ""Man, this kid..."" Because I asked him what his five year vision was, and he said that he wanted to essentially have a couple mowing crews and he wanted to fertilize full-time. That's what he is passionate about, that's what he enjoys to do. Then after we had lunch, I told Jake, ""This is what we need. We need a guy to come fertilize full-time.""
So actually one of the biggest sales tactics that we had was I showed him Crew Control. I showed him how easy it was to come out, lay out your schedule. One of the complaints that he had was when he'd go fertilize houses that people wouldn't pick up their dog poop or toys or stuff, it'd be laying out in the yard. And I showed him the texting function of, ""Hey, when you get back here at the end of the day, as long as that you're going to be at these properties the next day, you can just send them all the texts, let them know that you're going to be there the next day and make sure they have their yards cleaned up. And then also just building a schedule in terms of knowing how much that you can fertilize and how much that you can do.""
So just even getting him on was such a huge sales tactic for us. And also just something that I think our size of business compared to other businesses in the area that are smaller or the same size as us, I mean, I think it's just a huge selling point for us because it is something that's so easy to use that is such a helpful resource, in terms of a lot of times we'll get a small job where we'll just throw it in the unassigned and then it's up to those guys when they have time to get it done, that they just do it. They drive down their crew and they get it done.
So it's just been huge for us in that standpoint, and just putting it all together. I mean, it realistically shows... It's helped us from a pricing standpoint because we know how much we can take now, how much work we can actually do. So obviously when we're building our schedule, we have a dollar amount where we know we need to be at in order to obviously be profitable. And once you get close to getting that schedule full and you're still getting the leads, it allows you to have a little bit extra wiggle room on price to make sure that you're pricing things right to get where we want to be. And then you just know how much work you can really take on.
And then just even too, it's helped us on the back end of, at the end of every season, what we'll do is we'll go in and we'll calculate the average man hours of each property that it took for us to mow. Or even landscaping jobs, we go in, we track labor, we see how we come out of job. And it just helps us when we reevaluate and we go to price stuff, you make sure that like, ""Hey, this was under priced, so we got to bump it up. Or this one was priced well."" Or just making sure that we're always keeping track of that we're doing okay from a sales and pricing standpoint. And then also just making sure that we're being efficient and maximizing our workload from a work standpoint. So yeah, I mean, all those things combined. I mean, there's no way we would've gotten to as big as we are right now without Crew Control. And there's no way that we would be able to make the money that we are without it. It's been absolutely huge and it's been essential for our growth, to be honest.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Austin, you mentioned earlier that you use Crew Control to manage your subs as well. Is that true? Is that an easy process? What's that like?
Austin Hurst
 Yeah. We really only do it for snow. And the reason why we do it for snow is we typically use a lot of our subs to do the actual plowing and removal of the snow. And then our crews, we've got big salters on our trucks, so we come in and ice melt the parking lots after they're done. So that's just something where we started to use it for that, just because it allows us pretty easily to just track and see, hey, instead of driving around waiting, our guys can tell while they're out there, what properties are done so they know that they can go salt them. So it's just helped us with efficiency in that regard too, so that way we don't have guys just driving around trying to see what's done. They're actually able to just go in and see right away, ""Hey, this place is done. It's been marked off as completed by our subcontractors. So I know I can go in and salt everything and I know it's completely done.""
So that's really about the only thing we've used it for with our subcontractors right now, just because we know that it would save us time, just having our guys not having to drive around trying to figure out what's done and when it's done, just trying to make it more efficient on them as well. They want to get through a snowstorm as quick as possible, and from a business standpoint, we don't want to pay extra hours if we don't have to.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. Do you about 10 more minutes, Austin? I know we've gone over the 45 minutes I scheduled with you.
Austin Hurst
 Oh yeah. Nope, you're good.
Abby Hart
 Perfect. Do you guys use Crew Control payments? How are you doing your financials?
Austin Hurst
 So we actually don't. I actually talked to David about this as well. We just still, even though we use QuickBooks and I know Crew Control is integrated with QuickBooks, I just still manually do it myself, to be honest, just because it's what we've always done. It's just what I'm comfortable with. And it also just is that checks and balances of checking, making sure everything's good. And then I can also edit up some of the invoices just with the wording and stuff a little bit different than what we have in Crew Control. So that's just something where I just... Obviously I understand and know that it would be a little bit more efficient if I did it that way, but it's just something that I've always done it the same way and I'm comfortable with it. I just have my own method in terms of marking stuff off and everything, once I get it done and bill. So we don't right now, but maybe in the future, but as of right now, I mean, I'm pretty comfortable to be honest.
Abby Hart
 I asked because I'm actually working on another piece of content that is talking about how Crew Control payments works. And I was just curious if you use it and how you use it, but that's good to know. I think that there's a fair amount of people that are used to doing payments a certain way.
Austin Hurst
 Yeah. And I told David too... And obviously I think there's a lot of companies that you guys work with that would utilize that. I think that in terms of a selling standpoint if I obviously... Because I mean, I'm passionate about Crew Control and I talk to David all the time about... I want to give my input where I can to help you guys, because I just know that anything that has helped and anything that I might be able to add that might be beneficial is only going to provide a benefit to our company as well.
I mean, I told him, I think where you could really sell the Crew Control payments is for... Even if you circle back to 2018 when it was just myself and Jake, just not really having the time in the office to be able to go sit down and bill stuff, because you're out working all the time. I mean, I think that's the businesses that you can really sell that to, is the one, two men crews, where they're able to just easily send out an invoice to the customer after they complete work. I think that's a niche that would be really big for the payment aspect for you guys.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. Awesome. All right, Austin. Are there any... Oh, you mentioned Jake. That just reminded me. What is Jake's last name?
Austin Hurst
 Snook. S-N-O-O-K.
Abby Hart
 Great. And Jake Snook, what's his title? You are VP, and...
Austin Hurst
 Yep. He is the owner and president.
Abby Hart
 Okay, cool. All right, Austin, are there any... Oh, and do you use Crew Control... what's your experience with payroll and time sheets and clock in and all of that? How's [crosstalk 00:45:34]?
Austin Hurst
 So for payroll and stuff, we actually use just TSheets by QuickBooks for actual clocking in and clocking out for the entire day of day. We use Crew Control to clock in and out of individual jobs. So that way we're able to track how we're doing in terms of jobs and all that good stuff. So that's-
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. So you're not using that functionality?
Austin Hurst
 No. Nope. We are not. Just clocking in and out of individual jobs.
Abby Hart
 And is that just because you use QuickBooks for financials, so it's just easier to do both?
Austin Hurst
 Yep. When we started, we were just using TSheets and it's pretty user friendly in terms of switching stuff over from... It pretty much manually implements all the hours and stuff. So that's just same thing, we were just comfortable with it. It's what we've been using so we've just stuck with it for now.
Abby Hart
 Fair enough. Are there any specific metrics that you can point to improving? Like faster doing scheduling or improving non billable hour? Are there any metrics that you know that Crew Control has impacted?
Austin Hurst
 I mean, definitely just tracking billable hours is something that Crew Control's been huge for. And just even tracking drive time, because obviously even though that's technically might be quote unquote, ""not a billable hour"" it's something we want to make sure we account for and bill for. So being able to know, ""Hey,"" for example, ""We've got this property on our schedule or whatever, this job we're quoting, this would be the natural fit. So it looks it's going to be a 30 minute drive."" So making sure we're accounting for extra time because of that.
And then also just making sure we're being as efficient as possible. Just the budget we ran, we got a number where we know we need to be at for revenue per man hour. So making sure that we are trying to stay as close to that as we can. Obviously when we quote something, we have an idea of how long it's going to take, but you don't really know until you work on the property. So that's why it's huge for us too, looking back and reflecting the prior year of knowing how long these places would take so we can go and essentially see, ""Hey, we had five man hours in this place and let's say just for an easy number, we want to be at $50 of man hours. So that places essentially $250 just in labor to cover us."" So that's something too, that's just has been huge for us on the back end as well, making sure that we're covered there. I mean, that's been huge for us for sure.
Abby Hart
 That's great. I'm going to combine these two questions, Austin. So what business challenges are you currently facing and what are your goals for this year? And then I'm going to ask how you think how Crew Control is going to help you face those challenges and hit those goals.
Austin Hurst
 So I mean, our biggest challenge right now is just pretty much like anybody else, but especially in our industry, hiring good people, hiring the right people. Just because we're typically running off such of a limited applicant pool. I always joke around we don't have guys submitting resumes of college degrees to cut grass. So it's just something where we have a smaller pool of applicants typically. And from there we're also not going to compromise or jeopardize bringing in somebody who we don't think is a good fit just to hire a body. So that's been first and foremost, our biggest obstacle challenge that we've faced and continue to face. And unfortunately for us in our industry, I think it'll just always be a challenge. So that's the biggest one for sure. And then I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question again? I'm sorry.
Abby Hart
 So what business challenges are you currently facing? What are your goals and then how do you think Crew Control will help you face challenges and-
Austin Hurst
 Yeah, yeah. No, for sure. I would say the biggest goal just from... So I'm behind the scenes, business operations. So essentially I just say what my biggest goal is for the company is just, how can we squeeze every single dollar profit out of every single thing that we do, making sure we're being as efficient as possible, we're pricing things correctly. So I'd say personally, my biggest goal for the business for this year is making sure that we can get fertilizer off the ground and up and running, just because it's something where we're obviously going to have a decent size, we're going to have to invest a decent amount of money into it to get it going. We got to get a truck, trailer, proper equipment, order the product.
So my thing is just leaning on Crew Control, and making sure that we can take on the most work that we can to make sure that we can maximize the revenue that we're bringing in for that department. That's my probably biggest objective this year. And then also just continuing to monitor each individual department that we have and just continuing to make sure that we're always maxing out our schedule in terms of we never want to have a week where we have a Friday where we don't really have anything to do and these guys are coming in and we're not really making money. We want to make sure we're essentially maximizing pretty much every single dollar that we can make off of all of this, and keeping guys busy and keeping money rolling in.
And also just making sure stuff is priced correctly. I mean, that's one of the biggest detriments to any business is stepping on a property and knowing that even if you do it at your absolute fastest, highest efficiency rate that you can, knowing that no matter how quick you do that, you still underbid it, so you're not going to make any money. So just making sure that we stay on top of that, and that's just using Crew Control essentially to backtrack those hours. But that's also a team effort too because you got to go back and look at those hours, you got to look at where you're at for pricing and you got to make sure that your guys out in the field are logging stuff accurately. Clocking in when you park the truck, clocking out when you leave, making sure you got the right number of guys on the crew. So that's all a team effort for sure.
But just biggest goals for this year's just continue to keep growing, continuing to be more profitable. Really want to get fertilizer off the ground and going, want to do the most work that we can there. We don't want to obviously leave a bunch of periods of time empty. We want to max out the workload there to make sure that we can just obviously get the most out of it that we can, and Crew Control's going to be a huge part of all of that for sure.
Abby Hart
 Fantastic. All right, Austin, this has been great. I'm going to follow up with you when I have a draft for you to look at. But in the meantime, would you be able to send me your headshot and then some photos of the crew at work? Or maybe a team shot or something?
Austin Hurst
 Yeah, absolutely. I'll send it in that email chain that we've got.
Abby Hart
 Perfect.
Austin Hurst
 Blake does our social media as well, so I'll just have him gather some of what he thinks is the best photos and have him get them over to me, and I'll get those over to you.
Abby Hart
 Beautiful. Thank you so much, Austin. I should hopefully have something for you, I don't know, by the end of the week, maybe early next.
Austin Hurst
 Yeah. Whatever. Obviously take your time. No, I appreciate your time and just listening to our story. I mean, Crew Control's been a huge part of our success for sure. And I'm just looking forward to the continued growth and partnership.
Abby Hart
 Thanks so much, Austin. Thank you so much for your time. Take care. Have a great week.
Austin Hurst
 Yes. Thank you, Abby. Thank you for your time.
Abby Hart
 Bye bye.
Austin Hurst
 Bye."

 All right, Chris. So, what is your title over there at Enviroscapes?
Chris Kline
 I am a Landscape Designer and Commercial Estimator.
Abby Hart
 Okay, great. Are you the primary person that Joshua speaks with about Land One or-
Chris Kline
 Yes. Sorry.
Abby Hart
 Okay, perfect. Fantastic. So this is going to be, because I didn't realize until after the fact that Enviroscapes is also an Aspire user, I'm going to ask you background about Enviroscapes, and then we'll talk about Land One and then we'll also talk about Aspire. But if you feel like you're not the person to talk about Aspire in great detail, then I can talk to somebody else at Enviroscapes, if you think that's a good idea. Do you think that you can speak intelligently about both or-
Chris Kline
 Yeah, for the most part, Mike May, I would say he's probably the... he's with our corporate team. He's probably the most well versed in Aspire, but I don't have a lot of experience here at Enviroscapes outside of Aspire.
So the transition point may be a little, you know what I mean?
Abby Hart
 Gotcha.
Chris Kline
 We were purchased by Aspire. I worked for American Beauty Landscaping and we were purchased by Enviroscapes in 2017 and Enviroscapes got Aspire in 2018. So there wasn't a whole lot... I don't know how well I can speak of the two.
Abby Hart
 Gotcha. So, [crosstalk 00:01:41] you've been pretty well entrenched with Aspire but you have experience with other software, correct?
Chris Kline
 Oh yeah. Correct.
Abby Hart
 Okay, perfect. Yes. Well then that honestly might be enough, and it actually is an interesting perspective that you bring as a designer and an estimator, because I've primarily been speaking with owners and the decision maker behind bringing on Aspire.
So it'll be cool to talk about someone who uses it daily, because some of these guys don't. Okay, great. So Chris, how long have you've been with, I guess technically in, Enviroscapes, since 2017, you said? Or with your company?
Chris Kline
 2017. Yep.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. And how many people currently work at Enviroscapes?
Chris Kline
 250.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Chris Kline
 In that ballpark.
Abby Hart
 Okay. Can you talk a little bit about customer mix, surface mix and revenue? Is that something that you have that you can tell me, or-
Chris Kline
 Absolutely. Yeah. So we are a commercial landscaping company. We do some large-scale high end residential work, but it's mostly tied to commercial.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Chris Kline
 So we're 40% landscape, about 8.5 million. We're 40% maintenance and enhancements, at probably around nine million and then snow we're 20% at about four million.
Abby Hart
 Okay, perfect. I'm sorry. So doing the math, total rev is... you eight and a half nine and four?
Chris Kline
 Yeah, 21, 21 and a half.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. Let's see. Can you talk a little bit about your background and how you ended up at Enviroscapes and your day to day as an estimator?
Chris Kline
 Yeah, so like I mentioned before, I worked for probably the largest landscaping company in the Youngstown, Ohio market, which was American Beauty Landscaping. We were purchased by Enviroscapes in 2017.
And I was part of that merger, well purchase, not a merger. And so Enviroscapes we just integrated into their processes and their company. And as far as sales and estimating and design, I was actually a Field Supervisor. So I have about 15 to 16 years of in field experience with a hardscape field supervisor. So... high end residential, commercial work, installs, and I got the opportunity to move into sales.
So I grabbed the bull by the horns. So it was a real sink or swim type situation. And I was able to keep my head above water and I been doing this ever since. So it was really a great opportunity for me.
Abby Hart
 That's great. What drew you to the landscaping industry and your initial work in it, and then now to sales?
Chris Kline
 So I've always worked in landscaping. I really, other than some jobs here or there in college, when I was 16, I started cutting grass. And when I got my job at the first actual professional landscaping company, I ran a mow crew, and mowed grass for two or three years, got my pesticide applicator's license.
Did pesticide application fertilization and moved into a Maintenance Supervisor. And then I went into hardscape construction. So I'm pretty well versed in pretty much all aspects of landscaping, but really since I was 16, it's all I've really ever known.
I always wanted to do more. I was always very creative, very good at art, those types of skill sets. So it's really cool to look back now and it's like, ""Wow, all those talents that I have when I was younger, I'm actually using them now in my mid thirties too, as a career.""
And I never really thought I would... I thought I'd be laying brick the rest of my life, but it was just the right opportunity at the right time. And that's just the environment here. Enviroscapes, we like that we can do things here that you never really thought possible. We give those opportunities within first, and I think that's really a good thing.
Abby Hart
 That's great. So what do you like about what you're doing now, versus being a field supervisor?
Chris Kline
 The challenges day in and day out, just new, it's refreshing. I feel like I've built every type of patio I can build. I've laid driveways, I've [inaudible 00:07:06] and not that I don't still love that work, I still do, but it's just a new set of challenges on a day to day basis.
And it really was just refreshing to me to do something different and challenge myself as a person and professionally. So I think that's what I like most about it. I like the analytics of it, the dealing with customers. I think that was always my strongest suit was just dealing with the customer. And now it's on a much larger scale and it's not just a residential customer, it's just general contractors and architects and it's... Just being able to really, how do I want to phrase it, be being able to tap into that strong suit that I know I have and do that on a daily basis, pretty much.
Abby Hart
 That's great. So let me ask you this. Were you at Land One or using Land One before you, well, I guess you wouldn't have been using Land One as a Field Supervisor?
Chris Kline
 No.
Abby Hart
 Okay. So can you talk a little bit about the challenges you were facing prior to onboarding with Land One?
Chris Kline
 So I think the most specific example would probably just be lessening that degree of estimation error.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Chris Kline
 So allowing me to really provide the most accurate estimate that could be the quantity of plants on a job site, to just quickly measuring properties through a near map or a PDF, getting the volume or calculating the volume of material in an area more quickly. Those types of things, Land One has definitely helped.
I do use AutoCAD a little bit, but this is just a little bit more of a streamlined, basic tool. And I find myself using Land One 98% of the time. And Joshua was always really great at listening to the customer and, ""Hey, what do you want to see? Or how can we integrate this to make this more efficient?""
And he took our feedback and then a lot of times in those situations, you're like, ""Yeah, it'll happen.""
And he would implement... It would almost be within weeks. It's like, ""Hey, that thing we talked about, you can do that now."" Which was really cool because you felt like you were really getting feedback, and he was really listening to the clients.
So I think that's what really sold me on Land One, was just that relationship we have with him and just how far it's came. I mean, it really truly was a takeoff program at first and now I feel like it's a design program.
Abby Hart
 All right. So you mentioned streamlining the process, more exact estimates and measurements. Were you considering any other programs prior?
Chris Kline
 Yeah, there was a few others. To be specific, I probably couldn't remember because I did look at so many of them. We were shipping jobs out for takeoffs, a lot of times with there being, we have two Designer Estimators with Enviroscapes, and then we have a Business Developer and we have Account Managers in the maintenance side.
So there'd be times where we would get overwhelmed with projects and it was, ""Hey, let's ship this one off our takeoff. Let's just let somebody else do it, free our hands of it.""
And so I think that when Land One came across and it was just so simple to work with, you so quickly get what you need out of it. It just made more sense to do it in house because I was being able to get two things done in the time it took me to do one.
Abby Hart
 Can you get specific about an instance where Land One changed your business for the better, a particularly hard project design, or-
Chris Kline
 Yeah, I mean, there's been a few, it's hard to nail down to one. We've been on a project now where we've been doing a park restoration project for the past two and a half years.
And when it's all said and done, it's going to be a $5 million project and to be able to take that plan set. And we were a General Contractor on this project too. So it wasn't just landscaping. There was asphalt work construction, we're running a $900,000 pavilion structure build right now at this park.
So being able to use it and push its limits, and use it for things that most people don't, it helped. I mean, I was able to take that entire plan set document, and that's a lot of landscape plans and a lot of things like that. And it might sound funny, but the color coding of shrubs and color coding of perennials, things like that, it just made it easier on the guys in the field.
So you get that positive feedback it makes you, ""Wow."" This is worth it. It's worth the work. And they're starting to... Because if it trickles down to the production, if it makes my job easier, it makes their job easier, then it's a win for everybody. So that would probably be the one instance that comes to my mind is I was able to use on a job of that scale. And it was just a vital tool.
Abby Hart
 That's great. So, better communication and clearer plans [crosstalk 00:13:00] for your production crews. Great. Are there any specific metrics that you can point to as to how Land One has helped your design process or estimating process? I don't know if you guys track how fast these things go out, but are there any specific metrics like that?
Chris Kline
 Not really in that regard, as far as how fast we can turn around a bid, or turn around an estimate. From a design aspect, I think the integration of Near Map, that made a big impact because I'm no longer going to [inaudible 00:13:41] to pull an aerial photo or a measurement. I can do it all in one space.
Which is what's exciting to me about Aspire purchasing Land One is, I'm excited for what the future holds and that integration's really going to present itself a year or two, three years from now. So that was huge because as simple as that sounds, it's one less step and every time you got out another step, you're being more efficient, more productive.
So the Near Map was really great. I always teased Joshua a little bit because there was no copy paste feature. So I'd get these large distribution centers where there might be 50 island beds that are the exact same size. And it's like, ""Okay, this doesn't feel efficient.""
Now I can do that. And to set the little details go a long way. As far as like... I know it makes me more productive. I turn things around quicker, but as far as tracking that time, we really don't... we track our production probably a lot more closer.
Abby Hart
 Okay. So it's funny that you mentioned [Goilon 00:14:59] because you know that Aspire also acquired Goilon. How are you... now I'm just curious, because it's my job to know about all these solutions as we acquire them or as they partner with us, but how were you using go Goilon in conjunction with Land One, or, were you?
Chris Kline
 Oh yeah, a little bit. If it was a presidential project I could get on there to get my benchmark on a design, to going to design a patio or I'm going to design the layout of a sidewalk or a landscape.
I would go to Land One, get that benchmark measurement, or snip a photo, or download that photo and then transfer that to Land One, and then do my overlay where now it's very simple. It's right there.
I [inaudible 00:15:51], it pulls it up and I'm still getting that nice crisp image, depending on the year. There's leaves on the trees and all those fun things that come into play with that. But it's just, again, it just keeps cutting out that other step.
Abby Hart
 Okay, great. I'm still getting a sense for, or how... now that aspire has acquired Land One, the two solutions are not integrated yet. So can you... there is the plan for that, but I don't have a day, I just know that it's coming, but can you tell me how you use the two solutions in conjunction with each other? Just so I have a sense of the workflow, I guess.
Chris Kline
 Of?
Abby Hart
 I'm sorry, Land One and Aspire. So you design... Can you just walk me through?
Chris Kline
 Yeah. So, the good thing about Land One is... like AutoCAD, it doesn't necessarily give you layers, but in a sense, it does just a little bit more of a basic fashion.
I look at those plants, I go down through and create all the areas that I need to create. I do my take off and now there's that step from taking the information that I've gathered on Land One and transferring it over to my opportunity and Aspire. Now, what I hope to see is that integrate it does that for me, because that would begin cutting off that next step.
We're pretty well trained at that here. I think we do it our very best to try to find the quickest route to be more productive and be efficient. And that's definitely going to be that next step, which I'm confident they'll figure it out. That's what I'm doing right now. So that is that extra step, just transferring that information, but I'm no longer using that spreadsheet off to the side, so in a way I am still being a little bit more efficient.
Abby Hart
 Okay, great. I guess let's switch gears to Aspire for the moment and then we'll come back together and talk about both of them in conjunction. So can you tell me your experience using like business management software when you were at American Beauty and then... Were you using a software there?
Chris Kline
 I mean, we've always used some type of a software, but it was probably more paper based.
Abby Hart
 Okay.
Chris Kline
 Especially tracking times, so my experience with it was, again, from more of a field perspective, so making sure that my guys were clocking in, clocking out, making sure they were tracking billable and unbillable, all of those things. So I think that was probably the biggest challenge is not being able to really easily track that and see job costs.
That's been the biggest change is, I mean, what can't Aspire do? I mean, thing is, we really can see the big picture on just about everything.
And it's always evolving. I mean, it's evolved since we first started using it and we used to have management meetings where we would just share what we've taught ourselves. We were still learning it. And this is back in 2018, 2019. And it was like, ""Hey, I found out that you could do this or you could do this.""
And so it was just a collaborative effort really. And I guess that's my answer.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Okay. So job costing when you were in the field, a lot of it had to do with clocking labor and that kind of thing. Can you talk about once you moved over to the estimating design side, how Aspire impacted your day to day, I guess, aside from the job costing... Does that make sense?
Chris Kline
 I guess if I'm following you... maybe not job costing, but everything as far as ordering material and tracking POS and things like that, just having the ability for the guys in the field to pull it up on their phone and know the estimate, see the estimate, know where they're supposed to order their material from. It got a lot of the guess work... I think in the past, you may have a good relationship with a vendor and you automatically go to that vendor, but maybe that's not the most cost efficient answer for this project.
And you don't know what the estimator was thinking and you don't have that information readily available to you. Now you're buying your purchase material, that's more than what's a bid for the project. So really just some clarity, from the office to the field on, it talks to each other, so both of them know what each other's thinking and track that. And just again, it all goes back to productivity, so-
Abby Hart
 That's great. Okay.
Chris Kline
 Is that what you were looking for?
Abby Hart
 Yeah, absolutely. So, really a lot of it is... Communication, clarity, efficiency, cost effectiveness. That's really what I'm hearing. Is there anything else as far as... I'm trying to think of other value ads that I typically hear from Aspire customers.
Sorry. The last person I talked to was a Controller and that is a whole different set of... Let's see here. Any other operational efficiencies that you can think of that Aspire provides?
Chris Kline
 I mean, it's a little bit of everything. I mean a contact book. To be able to... I'm constantly searching for contacts in there because I know if I haven't dealt with that person in the past, my counterpart in Louisville, [Rhonda 00:23:01], she probably has. So I really truly think I use it just about for everything that it can be used for, from somebody in my position.
Just looks on properties and being able to pull up addresses and contacts and all of that. It really is just a vital toll. I mean, it's more than just an estimating tool. It's more than just a sales tool or anything. It just helps the business all the way around, just smooth.
Abby Hart
 That's great. Okay. I guess that really covers how your roles have improved using Aspire. Can you talk about what challenges Enviroscapes is currently facing? Obviously it's always growing, you guys just got acquired by Shell. Is that accurate?
Chris Kline
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 So what business challenges are you guys facing currently and how can Aspire and One Land help to meet those challenges? How have they been helping to meet those challenges?
Chris Kline
 So if I think of challenges, I think the first that comes to my mind is probably just the supply chain issue that we're facing all over. With this state of the world that we live in, the daily impacts that we're seeing within this industry and maneuvering those challenges and finding sustainable solutions, I think the pandemic really affected business and for that matter, continues to affect business, I think we have to constantly retold ourselves. And I think aspire has been a huge part of that. I think the green industry as a whole has done a really good job at maneuvering through the pandemic. I think, maybe I'm biased, but I think a [inaudible 00:25:04] especially we've really done a fantastic job making sure that we're keeping our employees safe and healthy and putting the right processes in place.
And if we wanted to work fully remote with Aspire, we could. There's just so many things that this program, I think, helps when it comes to the way that the world seems to be trending. It connects us all, being able to not be cooped up in an office with coworkers, but being out on job sites, but still being able to access all that data is important.
And I think it was... I wonder sometimes how we would've really done it when it first happened, because at first everybody was terrified and nobody really knew what was going to happen. And it was like, ""Are we going to have jobs? Are we considered essential, are we not considered essential?""
And nobody knew, and I think that as things became clear, I think what became clear to me with Aspire was, wow, how would we have done this without Aspire? And I think that was... to be able to sit in my living room and hop on and create an opportunity, that made things very easy.
So I just think that as far as challenges looking forward, who knows, with the state of this world, but I think it's a good tool to have in your arsenal for sure, because, it's proven effective in the past, so-
Abby Hart
 Great. I wanted to touch on, and this is something that I don't think I've heard anybody talk about, but you mentioned that Land One and to a certain degree Aspire, although I'd like to hear what you have to say about it, but Land One and maybe Aspire have enabled you to use these creative talents. Can you talk a little bit about how knowing these tools and using them effectively might help? other people in the industry...
Chris Kline
 So a good example of that is I've been able to help our maintenance department on multiple occasions, and it could be something as basic as a takeoff on a park for snow and ice, but creating details, you see these landscape details, and then plan sets, and it's not just a takeoff program.
You can use all the tools that takeoff program offers you, and you can create an actual detail on how you want a project built. It doesn't have to be a 2D, aerial image, it can be a masonry wall. It could be a set of steps. It is really your creativity, I think, is the only thing that limits what Land One can do.
I've overlaid renderings that were hand drawn with it, and been able to create a pretty full piece to present to a client. There's just a lot of different things you can do with it.
It's not AutoCAD, but it's for what it is, it serves a lot of those same purposes. I think you just [inaudible 00:28:45] willing to push it.
I know Josh and I shared designs that I had done and some things like that. And I think he even made the comment once that, ""You're using it a little bit more than what it's intended for, but that's good.""
So, it's a cool program. For me, I just can get lost in just playing around in it and seeing what you can do.
Abby Hart
 That's awesome. That's great. So, Chris, can you talk a little bit about what your goals are for this year and how Aspire and Land One can help you achieve those goals?
Chris Kline
 Yeah. I think my goal's always the same. It's going to sound cliche, but it's just to continue to grow and improve as a professional. I think that as I evolve as a designer and an estimator, I'm confident that Aspire and Land One will evolve along with me. So I think, like I said, it's been an invaluable tool for me.
And, I believe with that integration with Aspire that it's just going to become more beneficial to that growth. So I think that as time moves on, I mean, like I said, I really am excited. I told Josh that multiple times when I found out that Aspire acquired Land One, it was like, ""Oh, cool.""
It wasn't like it was another software program that we don't use where it's, ""Which direction is this going to go?"" Those were the two biggest tools that I use every day, is Aspire and Land One and now-
Abby Hart
 Oh, wow.
Chris Kline
 So now that they're coming together, that's exciting for me because to make our jobs as easy as possible and still... I think my goal is, like I said, just to always improve and always grow and I think that's how they can help.
Abby Hart
 That's awesome. Great. Let me think if I have any other questions that I wanted to ask... Chris, now that I've got you.
Chris Kline
 No, you're good.
Abby Hart
 Yeah. I mean-
Chris Kline
 [inaudible 00:30:54] so if you don't...
Abby Hart
 Do you read any particular websites to get education or information about the industry, Chris? This is just a question for me as a content creator in this space.
Chris Kline
 Yeah, Landscape Management, I'm a huge LinkedIn guy, so I'm always on LinkedIn reading. I would say probably I listen to my peers in the industry more than I do articles against the magazines or anything like that.
I have a stack of them here, but, I want to know what companies in Florida are doing or what companies in New Jersey are doing or California. What's the general consensus to the industry all over the country, not what somebody who's just writing about it is telling me, I want it straight from the source. So that's why I think I lean towards just reading LinkedIn. One thing about this industry and maybe it's just because that's the majority of the people I follow on LinkedIn, but they're very open.
They're not really hiding anything. They're just transparent with their business and their financials and their... It's like a community. And I know our Market President now, Todd Pugh, I know he's very transparent with us. And he's constantly talking to companies like east coast facilities or Loving Landscape or companies like that. They're constantly visiting each other and learning from each other.
And I think that's really cool that you're competitive, but at the same time that sharing and growing from each other, I think that's a really cool thing. And I just think that's what's special about this industry.
Abby Hart
 That's awesome. Is there any content that we can provide on Land One or Aspire that would really useful to you as an estimator or a designer? How did-
Chris Kline
 Yeah, I think as far as content... I think, again, I talk about reading things from around the industry, but it's mostly business owners. The Owners and the Presidents of those companies, sometimes it's the Controllers, like you had mentioned before, the guy you last spoke to.
But I would like to hear more from more estimators, more designers, how are you doing things? Maybe out of the box thinking, because I'm an outside of the box thinker. I don't box myself into what's the standard, this is what I'm going to do. If I can figure out way to do something and be more efficient, I'm going to do it. So I'd like to hear more of that from other estimators, other designers, and I'm sure if you asked our Field Supervisors, they'd tell you the same thing.
They want to hear more from other job Foremans or whatever you want to call them, Field Supervisor Foreman, just a little bit more of a personal connection would be nice too, because I don't see a lot of... There's a few estimators that I follow on there, a few design companies that I follow that I do keep up with, but besides showing off pictures of their designs that they're not really too much sharing how they do things. So I think that would be really good content for somebody in my position to read.
Abby Hart
 Given that it seems like you are a power user of Land One in your company and sounds like overall, given what Joshua has said about how you use it-
Chris Kline
 I'm really the only one to be honest with you. I've been pushing it and I keep trying to sell it to our maintenance guys. Like, ""I think this would be good. You know what I mean? I think you guys could use this."" And [inaudible 00:34:51] they love to be able to go on there on their iPad and create a quick design. And it's like, ""Hey, you can do that on Land One.""
So, I actually met here with Tom Ferguson is his name, he's our account manager for our Youngstown branch. And he sat here and we spent about an hour on Tuesday. And I gave him a crash course and he just hopped on my account and played around with it for a minute and I pulled up what he did, and I'm like, ""Oh man, I'm not a bad teacher.""
That's pretty cool to see, so I do see a potential and I told Joshua that I definitely see a potential in more people in Enviroscape using the program, but it's my primary pull. So I'm using it every day. And so, I guess I am in a sense.
Abby Hart
 Are there any other applications that you see for it that you think would be helpful for other estimators or designers to know about?
Chris Kline
 I guess just what I mentioned before with it being more of a design tool than just a takeoff program because I feel like that might be the label that it gets is, it's a takeoff program.
You're going to be able to find the square footage of that piece of lawn or that mulch bed or... But again, I like to push it to its limits and I like to try to design with it as much as possible. And I had told Joshua a while back, ""We need textures. We need those types of things. I need to be able to distinguish what's a rock bed from a mulch bed."" And within 2, 3 weeks, it was like, ""Oh, I have textures now.""
So it was really cool, and those types of advancements and things like that, I think that's what's really made it up its game a little bit to become more design program. There's still things I'd like to see, there's things I would like to pick his brain about and things of that nature. But I have no problem searching for items that I need, whether it be furniture, boards, things like that.
I find the images, I purchase them off Adobe and then I transfer them over to Land One and I use them within my designs. So I mean more options like that would be great. There's always room to improve for everybody, as well as a program. So those are things I've shared with him in the past. But like I said, I think there's optimal opportunity, especially here for a lot of use.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. Great. Okay, Chris, I think that we've pretty well covered my questions if I have any. What I'm going to do is I'll probably work on this over the next week. I'm hoping by the end of the week, I'll have a draft for you. Would you be able to email me your headshot and any design or something that I can use the blog post? That would be awesome. I don't know what you have access or what you think we should have permission to use, but-
Chris Kline
 You can use whatever. I don't covet anything that much. So I want to share, you know what I mean? I want people to see this is what you can do with it, so I can get some stuff together... Trying to think if I have a headshot. The last time we took pictures...
Abby Hart
 I know, I need to get mine done too, so I get it. So whatever you can send my way, I will have a draft for you hopefully at the end of the week, next week.
Chris Kline
 Yeah, and I mean, if there's anything that pops up from now, till then that you want to add, just shoot me an email. I'll give you [crosstalk 00:38:46]
Abby Hart
 Thank you so much, Chris.
Chris Kline
 No, thank you. I have a terrible sinus infection, so hopefully I made sense. I'm a little foggy.
Abby Hart
 You could not tell at all, but I will be in touch if I have any follow ups.
Chris Kline
 Okay. Awesome. Thank you so much.
Abby Hart
 Thanks so much, Chris, take care. Bye bye.
Chris Kline
 Bye."

 Sorry, distracted me. That you can find the free templates and you can use those all over the place and you can figure out your pricing and you can print out a bill and hand them to the customer, but that's not what you really want in estimating software kind of thing for you. The software does so much more, ties into your other business practices, like your accounting, your scheduling, and your mobile app and those kinds of things. That's where we're going with this, we want to provide the value add of using an estimating template within a software and not just a free thing that you can find online.
Tabitha
 Okay.
Diana
 Abby, is that fair?
Abby
 Yeah. So Tabitha, that kind of explains what... So this blog post that has been written is explaining there's landscaping estimate templates out there, but what you want is to go a step further and actually have it, a robust estimating feature within your business management software.
Diana
 [inaudible 00:01:20].
Tabitha
 Right. The templates in Aspire are going to be, typically to a prospect, how I explain it is it's their common language, their common services, their common scope of work, things that will help speed up, things that they're doing frequently, things that will speed up their estimating process, so within each of their divisions, maybe it's an irrigation division or a janitorial division or a maintenance division, their common scope of work can be preset. And what that means is their language is already there, they already know the property, the billing contact, all of that's going to pull in, and then you're going to start the estimate itself. So within that estimate itself, you're going to have a cost catalog within Aspire so you know that you're pulling in, I don't know if at that point you want to bring in, we have that integration with site one.
Abby
 Would it be easier Diana, if Tabitha walked us through.
Tabitha
 Do you want me to share my screen.
Abby
 Yeah, demonstrated creating an estimate, is that...
Diana
 Yes. That would be good.
Tabitha
 Within Aspire, when you're thinking of your templates, we have two different types of contracts or of opportunities. One's going to be a contract, that's going to be your recurring services. And then the other is going to be a work order, and that's your one time jobs, it's more like your plant installs, you're not going to install that same plant again, you're just going to install it that one time. Within those different divisions, you can have different templates set up for, like I said, the common services scope of work.
Maybe in your enhancement division, you have a few, in your irrigation division, you have a few, in your maintenance division, you have a few. They don't all have to be exactly the same. And then once you select that actual template, certain information is prepopulated and it's your common information so it's going to look different for every single company, but information that's going to prepopulate is that scope of work so it could be proposal description one, proposal description two. In both areas, I would note that there's merge field tokens so you don't have to retype it. Things like your property name, your billing, your customer name, it's going to know from the property that you're at, what information it needs to pull.
Diana
 And that's automated, right? So once you put this in into a template, it's in there, it's stored and they can just pull it up every time they [crosstalk 00:04:03].
Tabitha
 Exactly. Other things that can prepopulate is going to be the division, the invoice type within, and I would probably mention that because it is a full business management system. That invoice type is important because depending on this invoice type is going to depend on how it gets through the invoicing assistant. So you're selecting that at the opportunity level with your estimating, and it can be part of the template that you've set up.
Diana
 So with that in mind, click on that invoice type again, so this fixed payment, and so that's used with what? I mean, that's just a one time...
Tabitha
 Sure. This is a contract, so that means it's recurring services. What fixed payment means is this is a $12,000 maybe contract, and they are paying me at fixed amount every month. They're paying me a $1,000 dollars every single month.
Diana
 Got you.
Tabitha
 What a per service means, is truly per service. Within a contract, you might have a weekly mow visit and in the fixed payment, I'm paying that same amount, no matter how many times it actually gets mowed, where per service it's not going to trigger into invoicing assistant until that individual service is complete. So I've done a mow and now I've said it's complete, now it's in my invoicing assistant. And then the last one for a contract is time and material.
Diana
 Time and material. All right. So that's where you feel like material prices went up or something, you might have this in a template, but your price... I also understand that, do you guys use price book with landscaping with the Aspire like ServiceTitan does or not? I forget.
Tabitha
 We have a cost catalog is what is going to be considered instead of a price book. And with that cost catalog, we do have an integration with site one that updates nightly. So I would probably tie that in to make sure they're using the most common prices they could use that integration.
Diana
 And so it updates every night, and so the next day, if the price went up, that previous day, that would show up the next day. All right. Got you.
Abby
 And that would be another value add that's built into the automated piece of the... Because it does update nightly, so you're always going to have a pretty accurate view of what your material costs are.
Diana
 That's where the pricing accurately comes into place. Okay, got you.
Tabitha
 And managing that. Their cost catalog as well, just from other nurseries, I would say maybe other nurseries and vendors, you're going to be able to upload those prices as well. So then when you actually start the estimate itself, and I will note that that invoice type was just for contracts, they are four different ones for work order, those one time jobs so we can look at that too, if you want to. But because we are using a template, those common group services and items, I'm going to collapse this.
We have a three level hierarchy with our estimating. The first level of hierarchy is groupings, it is purely organizational, how do they like to organize their quotes? Do they like to see their regular maintenance versus their irrigation versus their colors or their flowers? It's up to them, but that's where this is coming into play and it's a template, so it's auto pulling. Underneath the groupings, we're going to have our services, and these services are what drives our work tickets to be scheduled and also drives the price to our clients.
Diana
 [inaudible 00:07:47] spring clean up, all clean up.
Tabitha
 Yep. And we work off of the multiple overhead recovery system. They can be down to service type, I don't know how detailed you want to be in this or not, but...
Diana
 Well, go ahead and explain that since you started. I don't know if...
Tabitha
 Okay. Yeah. Essentially we have all of the cost, we have that cost catalog. And even though the cost of my mulch is the same, no matter what service I'm performing, I might want to mark it up differently depending on those services. So my mulch price is $65 when I'm quoting it in my maintenance, maybe I want to mark it up a hundred percent for a material, but if I'm quoting it in an install job, maybe I'll want to mark it up 120%. Within each of these individual services, you're going to have a markup through the multiple overhead recovery system.
Diana
 Okay. And the markup's about your profit margins, right? And basically...
Tabitha
 Yeah.
Diana
 Okay.
Tabitha
 Yep. And another thing that other software does not offer is within one contract, even though we said this was a fixed payment, we can have a per service, service or a time and material service within this one contract. Important when you think of things like snow for our clients is they might have their shoveling as a fixed payment, but they want their salt as a per service, as I'm using this salt, I'm going to bill you different or maybe I wanted as a time and material.
Diana
 When would they do that kind of thing? Do people do that often or?
Tabitha
 Yeah, that's a pretty big differentiator that other people don't, in snow in general.
Diana
 Okay. What about mulch? If you talked about mulch [inaudible 00:09:50] go as far as like marking that up. Is that based on like just higher cost of mulch or?
Tabitha
 Yeah, a lot of the services it's depending on the service they're performing. So here's the group my service and then these are the items, task and materials, and these are going to be considered Aspire items that you're actually performing while you're there. So I'm doing mowing, I'm doing some edging, different things like that. And I can have my own production factors in a kit created with that. This is also a pretty big differentiator because I'm setting my own information and I'm essentially telling Aspire, well, I know that I can do 10,890 square foot per hour, if I'm push mowing. So as I increase my square footage, it's going to tell me how many hours it's going take me to get that completed.
Diana
 Oh, nice. Okay.
Tabitha
 Now even though you have your typical production rates, we're going to call those kits. We also have a complexity factor and what that's going to consider is, Hey, this is my normal production factors, but for this job, the soul is super rocky, or I've got to go through three gates and down a hill. And it's just going to be more complex of a job than normal mowing. So I'm going to increase my complexity factor, which is not going to change any materials, but it's going to increase the amount of hours that I need to do that job.
Diana
 Okay. I think with that in mind, I was just thinking of your complexity and how they're priced just based on how long it takes, right? And if it's push mower, that's laborious, so that's going to take longer and so your labor costs are in there. What about like gasoline? Is that factored into this cost too? As far as this,
Tabitha
 It's not. As Aspire is going to be managing just all your direct costs and that's the multiple overhead recovery comes into place so things like your salary employee, your fuel, gasoline oil, all of that's going to be considered overhead and into that markup. The materials that you are going to have is maybe your fertilizer that you're putting down, maybe roundup plants, any of that's in the estimate would be considered material that you would want to actually have in here. You could have a kit that has labor and materials included. So this is me doing fertilizer. I know the same production rate for my square feet per hour but I also know for this material, how many pounds per square foot I need.
Diana
 Okay.
Tabitha
 Now as I change my quantity of square feet, it's going to tell me how many pounds of my dimension that I need. And that's going to go into my purchasing assistant to help me purchase my inventory.
Diana
 Okay. Very detailed.
Tabitha
 Yes. Yeah. That's why I didn't know how familiar, if you've seen it before, if you've...
Diana
 I've seen some of this, but not as digging deep into all little boxes. And there's so many things that landscaping that they do, you got to think about you got to support that story about fuel surcharges. Where are they adding that into the estimate? I mean, I don't know.
Tabitha
 Yeah. So the other thing to talk about, here is the items, the task materials I'm performing during this service and I said that service is driving the markup, that service is also driving our work ticket so once the client signs off on this, we become what we consider a work ticket management system so you're going to have in this example, 44 tickets for your weekly turf maintenance program. And that's really important when you think of job costing, because then I can see, how did I perform this week on hours? How did I perform last week? I can see all 44 of this contract, every single time I go and mow, did I go over the hours? Did I go under the hours? How do I do on my materials? I've got that accurate job costing for every week, that's going to roll up into this full contract and then roll up into the property so I can see it at a granular level.
What we find in landscaping is a lot of times, it's not to the end of the agreement. They're like, oh, we didn't make money. Because of the way you've estimated with these granular services, you're going to know as you perform these services, if you're profitable or not.
Diana
 Okay. Because it rolls into the reporting for the technicians too, right? So you can see if you had five different technicians go out to this place within the last five weeks or whatever, then you can see how they did and how each one of them performed and whether or not you're going to, I mean, if you're paying them more for doing longer work, that kind of thing?
Tabitha
 Yeah. Yes. We're instead of technicians, we're going to call them crew leaders.
Diana
 Okay.
Tabitha
 So instead of sending out a one technician, we are more likely sending to do this mowing for people where one of them is going to be a crew lead so you would be able to track it by crew lead, but not the individual and see who was on that crew with them. But it's not going to be within that crew, those individual performances, you would not be able to track necessarily.
Diana
 Okay. All right, I got you.
Tabitha
 But yeah, it's any of the communication so within this service is if there's particular communication, you need to give to the team in the field that crew, their crew is going to see how many hours they have to actually perform that work so this is going to go into your crew mobile. So you're really setting this estimate up to drive the rest of the system.
Diana
 So let's talk about that for just a second, that's kind of where we were going toward with this interview is just trying to understand what are those other things that estimating does too, so you said like, you just talked about a bunch of them, but I know that some of the ones that I listed in here were like, let's see, call booking the CRM software that helps book those jobs, scheduling, dispatching, payroll, purchasing, reporting, and accounting. So you're talking about materials, you're talking about reporting as far as knowing if you're making a profit, what your margins are, those kinds of things.
Tabitha
 Yeah, for our side of the CRM like this fire side, I wouldn't consider CRM call booking necessarily. To me, the biggest difference is with service site and it's like someone's called, I've got a plumbing problem, I've got HVAC problem, and you're dispatching more immediately, this is more, I've talked to these people and we're scheduling out these services. It's a contract of I'm coming here 44 times a year to mow your grass so you're still having that communication definitely the CRM. I just probably wouldn't use that window.
Diana
 It's more like the recurring maintenance services, right?
Tabitha
 Recurring maintenance, install work. Yeah.
Diana
 Scheduling those. It takes a lot of touches from the office staff too, as far as getting them on camera.
Tabitha
 Yeah. So what this estimate's driving, I usually open my navigation pane here on the side so we're going to consider the estimate is an opportunity in Aspire and like I said, we have two types. But they're very similar in type is both types are going to have this three level hierarchy. The only difference between a contract or the main difference between the contract and the work order is going to be the invoice types will be different and in a work order, I'm not going to have this occurrence column. This is my recurring services, a work order, like I said, I'm going to do this service of a plant installation one time and then it's going to go. And both of them though, any of these materials that you've had in this opportunity is going to go into our purchasing assistant automatically. You can refer to that as a grocery store list. You said what you needed and now it's down here on my list to actually make that purchase.
The service itself is going to become a work ticket and it's going to set in a holding sale here on our schedule board so you're essentially just going to have a list here on my schedule board and it's a drag and drop environment so I'm going to have the hours, we can get deep into things, but basically they're just going to drag and drop that to wherever they needed it to go. It's going to tell them how many hours you're going to be able to see the crew you've put it on and all of that. Any of the communication is all going to follow that work ticket that was originally the service in your opportunity.
Diana
 What's the significance of the color colors on that?
Tabitha
 These are the different routes, the different crews. Now I want to go back a couple weeks, my demo data. When we were thinking of the job cost thing, especially like that recurring maintenance, that's what my job status bars are here for. It's telling me that I had originally estimated this was going to be 6.92 hours, I've used 97% of those hours and the check mark's telling me this is a completed service. I'll switch over to, this is my landscape side, but so that's the importance of driving those work tickets down is it's going to tell you how many hours within that work ticket, any of that communication is going to show on your mobile device. And then you're going to see all 44 visits so here's my 21st mow out of the 44 mows that I had in this contract. And then I can run reports on that, how did I perform on the first 20?
Diana
 Interesting. Okay.
Tabitha
 And then depending on that invoice type, that opportunity is going to drive into our invoicing assistant. And our invoicing assistant is going to hold all of our invoices... Sorry, my Internet's been a little slow today. All of our invoices, you're actually going to invoice out of Aspire. You're going to do your collections out of Aspire, and then you're going to descend the deposit amount into QuickBooks. So we don't really have a full two way sync with QuickBooks, we're more pushing the data into QuickBooks instead, or the accounting system.
Diana
 So there's no double entry required, right?
Tabitha
 That's right.
Diana
 Okay. Now, are you the one who actually trains clients on how to use all this? As far as like... Go ahead.
Tabitha
 I am not, I am the one that shows it during the sales process.
Diana
 Okay.
Tabitha
 Yeah, I think my internet I've had trouble with it a few times today. And then because you're doing your opportunities here, like those estimates you'll be able to run your clothes ratio percentages, you'll be able to have like a prospect pipeline out of Aspire so if you're thinking of that side of estimating, perhaps, I don't know, you could go a lot of different ways with estimating so I don't know.
Diana
 What do clients talk to you about when you're actually showing them through the sales process? Are they overwhelmed by all this information? Or do you guys have to help them set it up? Or it takes a little bit of set up in advance? I mean, they need to prepopulate that information in there.
Tabitha
 Yeah. As we're going through the sales process, every client or every prospect really has different questions that they're asking. Most of the prospects are doing estimating, they're doing invoicing, they probably have the production factors, but they're in a lot of different systems and what we're trying to push is this is one complete system like you had mentioned at the beginning. On the sales side, we call it a Franken-system, you've got all of these different pieces that you've patch work together. It's been good, they're probably good different pieces of software, it's just that they don't talk to each other so you might be lacking efficiencies and communications because of it. Having a system like Aspire where you're doing your CRM, you've got that two way sync with outlook or your Google calendar.
But really once you get to that opportunity estimate, it's driving everything else so you no longer have to worry, Hey, I've done this estimate, I'll send it out to the client and they signed off on it. But I forgot to tell my production team and I set it on their desk and it's gone and now the client's wondering when it's going to get done and we've lost that piece of communication. Instead, that work ticket is setting on that schedule board for the production manager as soon as the client signed off. The same with the purchasing of the materials and your job costing is all of those materials from that estimate went directly into my purchasing assistant so I didn't have to worry about, oh crap, what did I put in that estimate it's there, it's my grocery store list, it's ready to go.
And now I just call my vendors and say, okay, this is what I'm needing, do you have it in stock? You're receiving that, you're mashing up your invoice from your vendor in Aspire as well. And that's how you've got your accurate job cost thing because you've got that exact invoice and then we're pushing it over into QuickBooks to actually pay. So your QuickBooks becomes a general ledger and a checkbook and your operations staff, the majority of your team is just working in Aspire. And then the same type of thing at the end, your productions manager is approving the ticket, ""Yes, this was completed."" And depending on how that invoice type was set up, it goes into your invoicing assistance. Like, okay, cool. My production team no longer forgot to tell my invoicing folks that it was ready, plus it's coming from my original estimate. So I didn't do an estimate on Excel and then retype it into QuickBooks the invoice, it's already there. I didn't have to retype anything.
Diana
 So everybody's seeing the same information all in the same place. And I'm sure that their customers are appreciating. Do they get like a more itemized list of what services they're getting and better communication, would you say?
Tabitha
 Yeah. You would say better communication. We also have the issue functionality, which has a negative connotation, we keep joking, we need to rebrand it because issues is a negative word, but it's just a three way communication tool. It's for the people in the office to communicate with your field staff and also with your clients. Within that one issue, you can have some internal and external communication going on.
Diana
 And they can also e-sign and they can schedule jobs online, it just makes it a lot easier. So follow up, those things are on your board somewhere that this was an estimate that was like your open estimates. How are those handled?
Tabitha
 Yeah. So basically we have dashboards and like you said, we've got all of this operational data rolling through Aspire. So depending on the user, the user role, the company, these different dashboards can be created. We usually say these are just examples of what you could be pulling if you are in AR more of accounting, you might want to see everything to invoice and your agent pass through balance. If you're someone that's in sales, maybe you want to see your prospect pipeline and your closed ratio. You might want to see gross margin percentages by division, you might want to see them per quarter or per month or per this week. All of these dashboards are changed. I wouldn't say any company has the exact same dashboards and then they're drillable so if I wanted to see the list of information, they created this prospect pipeline, I just click into it. Now I can see the property, the primary contact, the activities that's coming up, the last activity.
Diana
 Nice.
Abby
 You could also drill down on how fast you're getting these estimates out, right? Tabitha, just so you can keep an eye on how quickly your estimators are getting quotes clients?
Tabitha
 Yeah.
Diana
 Okay. And do you guys do the tiered options when you're doing landscaping estimates like ServiceTitan does, the good, better, best thing. If they present estimates, here's the premium level, here's the middle level, here's the lower level, just give customers options?
Tabitha
 Not really people did that, but I wouldn't say that's a big value add.
Diana
 Okay. I think that was it. I just wrote down, basically. I was just looking through what he was asking and they talked a lot about adding equipment and materials, like you can set that to automate but then if something comes up or prices change, can you go in and make those changes easily?
Tabitha
 You ask about equipment in particularly?
Diana
 Equipment and materials.
Tabitha
 Okay. Because we work on the multiple overhead recovery system, our best practice is to not put equipment in our estimates.
Diana
 Okay.
Tabitha
 So I leave equipment out. It's gets you down another hole that you aren't going to want to go down, you could say that for materials though. For your materials, you have that cost catalog so it's always using those markups to give the most accurate price to your clients.
Diana
 So how do landscapers track their equipment purchases and material? I mean, not materials, but the equipment they use to mow the yards and that kind of stuff. Where does that come into play?
Tabitha
 So we do have an equipment section of Aspire that you can track it, you can see what routes is assigned to and things like that. But as far as including it in our estimates, we consider equipment overhead and you include that in a percentage of your markups.
Diana
 I got you. And tell me, you're basing your estimates on what exactly? So you're talking about materials used, right?
Tabitha
 Right. So yeah. We'll go back into the opportunity.
Abby
 Yeah. Time materials.
Tabitha
 Yeah. It's going to be the hours you're there, those particular time so we're going to consider it labor. It's going to be these categories, you're have your labor material... We have equipment in here, but this is just for rental equipment so I would say you're thinking of your costs of goods sold so your labor material, equipment sub and other, but that is considered rental equipment.
Diana
 And sub would be like subcontractors?
Tabitha
 That's right.
Diana
 Got you. And what falls into the other category?
Tabitha
 Other could be like disposal fees, permit fees, that kind of thing.
Diana
 All right. I think that helps a lot to understand, especially the equipment, because I know with plumbers and HVAC people, they're putting the equipment into your house, but landscapers are using it on your house.
Tabitha
 Yeah.
Diana
 What else Abby, think we got it?
Abby
 I think that's pretty good. We've drilled down on how intricate the estimate has to be in order to feed all the other areas of the system. Is there anything else?
Diana
 We can talk about payroll.
Tabitha
 Yeah. Once we had talked about, it creates the work ticket and that work ticket gets scheduled. At the end of the day or the beginning of the next day, they would open this time injury, some time on Jane for today.
Someone over your crews would open this time entry and they would see the payroll time for the day so this is my crew. This is how much they worked for today. They would also be approving how much they worked per service, per job. So I was only at the bio building, this is how long I was there. I would have a difference time, and the difference time is the true difference between I was plugged in for payroll and I was performing work on these job sites, their geo stamps so you were going to see I'm not in the right location because I'm red, it would be green if I'm in the right location. But that difference time is auto-allocated when I hit save and I've already hit save on this one to the jobs you performed that day so there was a difference of point 12 hours when I hit save earlier, I've only been on one job so that drive time difference, time went automatically allocated to my bio building.
So to me, this is like the first stage of approval for my payroll. Someone in operations is confirmed, this is my payroll time, this is how much materials, this is how long I was there, everything's good. I've looked at all of my crews and it's essentially building the payroll file that you're going to export to the payroll system at the end of the week so whenever you actually send it to your payroll system, you'll go to the weekly time review. You will see a status pending as long as your operations manager has approved that, it's going to say unaccepted if they haven't approved it yet so if I'm a payroll, someone that's just processing payroll, not in operations at all, I can say, Hey, my operations, manager's not signed off on this is what his teams work for the week. I don't want to send this to my payroll system until he looks at it.
This is telling me that they have looked at it and it's ready to be approved. I can print a sheet to have them sign off on the hours per individual employee and once that's done, we can export the information into a payroll system or we have that direct sync with QuickBooks desktop payroll.
Diana
 Okay. So the there's no time tracking by individual employees, you're basically, you've got your crew leaders tracking the people they're working with putting this in.
Tabitha
 Yeah, those individual employees will still clock in and out for payroll purposes.
Diana
 Okay, with the crew mobile. Is that still happening? The crew mobile?
Tabitha
 Yeah. With the crew mobile. But the crew leader, once they're clocked in for the day, the crew leader is saying, okay, now we're at the bio building, my whole team. And then we're at the bell center, my whole team, the individual crew members don't have to do that throughout the day.
Diana
 I got you. Basically it's automating payroll, putting the information in the system so it can track it for you instead of having to write it down and lose papers and not pay people correctly and that kind of stuff.
Tabitha
 Yeah. But it's all going to be tracked, we consider the payroll file. So the payroll file is all going to be tracked through the crew mobile.
Diana
 Okay. All right. I think I've got my questions ask, Tabitha, do you think we have a good understanding as far as what the estimating template can do for clients? I mean, I just want to make sure that I'm doing what Dan is asking for here.
Abby
 Yeah. I think just as long as we're making the distinction. Okay. So we have an estimate template downloadable that will link in this blog post. But when we're referring to templates in the system, that is like a different...
Tabitha
 That's what I was going to ask, is early at the beginning, you said templates so Aspire templates are going to be like, every client is going have a different template that they set up. It's their common services, their language, their services, their items, how they want to structure it. It's nothing that we are actually providing them.
Abby
 Yeah. I think that like... And this would've helped to give you background on this Tabitha, but I seriously just set this up [inaudible 00:34:32].
Tabitha
 That's okay.
Abby
 Went off to Ireland for a few days and I just came back last night, so that's why everything was crazed. This blog post starts off talking about like, you could get a landscape estimate template and you can submit this, you can use this downloadable estimate template, which is basically a landscape proposal template, which is different from an estimating template in the way that we're talking about it here. But when we talk about templates within Aspire, what we're talking about is like Tabitha was saying like every user or every company within Aspire will set up their own set up templates based on whatever services they use most often, or they contract for most often. There's this downloadable PDF template that is a landscape proposal template, but then templates within Aspire is what she was showing us here so like recurring... Now I can't remember what template you just showed us.
Diana
 Recurring services and work order. Just to clarify that, Abby, so you said a lot there, so the template though, we're going to give them a free template. We're going to link to a free template from Aspire as a starting point basically, right?
Abby
 Yeah, that's their like lead gen. Oh yeah, I want to make sure my proposals are professional. But then what we're talking about is, well, within Aspire the solution streamlines estimating in such a way that you don't have to worry about this, this and this, because like, these are the value drivers that the estimating process within Aspire gives you. Does that make sense? Like, so you're able to easily estimate like 44 recurring maintenance services and be able to see within each service how you're performing against hours and material for each service. It is a robust estimating process that no other solution gives you.
Diana
 Right.
Abby
 Yeah. We're kind of talking... I mean, it's a little bizarre, we're sort of talking about two different things.
Diana
 Oh, I think we're talking about the same thing we're just talking about.
Abby
 Oh, no, no. I mean like within the blog post, like you have downloadable plus we're talking about Aspire, the estimating feature.
Tabitha
 Yeah. The only other thing I would say is when you're thinking of templates or how it's actually presented to your client is we're going to have different proposal layouts.
Abby
 Yes.
Tabitha
 So we don't call them templates, but this is pretty much the one area of Aspire. That's going to be fully customized, personalized, however you want to say it, all of these different fields that they're filling out the scope of work proposal description one, those groups services and items that within the estimate itself, they get to determine how do I want my client to see this? Do I want to show them unit pricing? Do I want to show them lump sum? Like how detailed of the information do I want to show them? And it's very common that our clients have more than one layout of what this looks like.
Diana
 Would you say simple is better? Like one page, two page?
Tabitha
 No, we don't usually recommend, on this one is only two page, but our one example is 15 pages. When you're thinking of a contract, because you've got all of the mowing, your fertilizer, you might have some EPA regulation information you have to include in it.
Diana
 More detailed the better it sounds like.
Tabitha
 Yeah. So it just depends on how they need every state, every locality is different, especially with the EPA regulations.
Diana
 Okay. Well I think I've got it. Is it okay? Tabitha, Did you tell me the Tabitha was going out? Are you going out of town next week?
Tabitha
 Well, I'm leaving for our client conference, but I'll be available so if you need to set up something or...
Diana
 If I just have an email question, can I email you? Sure.
Tabitha
 Absolutely.
Diana
 All right, cool. I will do that.
Abby
 And I was trying to squeeze this in Diana. I just like called this while you're on town because I am leaving for night on Wednesday. So yeah, like I'll be gone Wednesday to Friday but I mean, I will also be available-ish.
Diana
 I'll try to go ahead and work on this today and tomorrow and get something by tomorrow. And maybe you can look at it before you go.
Abby
 Fantastic. Yeah.
Diana
 After Wednesday or by...
Abby
 I'll be able to look at it. It's not like I'll be totally unreachable from Wednesday to Friday. I'll definitely be around. It's just more that I'll be covering sessions and stuff like that.
Tabitha
 Won't be at our computers all day.
Abby
 But yeah, I think as long as we're following what Dan, I think he used the HVAC template estimating page as an example. I think as long as we're following that format, I think we're okay.
Tabitha
 Okay. Perfect.
Abby
 Tabitha. That was so helpful. Thank you. I actually have never like gotten the full estimating demo. Things are slightly different than what I thought they were so that was helpful.
Tabitha
 Yeah. Anytime, if you want me to share around the system, happy to do it.
Abby
 Oh yes. I will probably sneak in one of your demos if I can here soon.
Tabitha
 You know what Abby? I have one recorded.
Abby
 Oh yeah. I have a couple from Corey, but if you give anything that's of use, and then I can link it to our marketing hub and then Diane can reference it to you. So.
Diana
 Sure. Absolutely. Yeah. Abby, I notice you hit record on this. I'm also recording. Are you planning sending the transcript or yeah.
Abby
 I'll send it to Rev right after I get this and I'll send you the link Diana.
Diana
 Wonderful. Okay. Nice to meet you Tabitha, thank you for all the information.
Tabitha
 Bye, see you Abby.
Abby
 Bye-bye ladies."

 I'm recording now and I'll let you take it away for a second.
Mark Layton
 Chris jump in, because I know probably your approach is going to be a little different than mine, obviously. Typically, all the dashboard stuff's going to be the same, whether it's janitorial or landscape, for the most part. The only thing different would be maybe some of the widgets would be set up a little bit different, but that's going to be customized per user anyway, so that's really not a big deal. But it's really more when you get into properties and where you filter for what we demo. So right now it's looking at a sales pipeline from a CRM, but we'd change that to customer. I don't know, have they created, Chris, yet the one that just defines between janitorial and landscape?
Chris Coulter
 So if you go into customer, property, anything under sue now is more janitorial specific. So like Plaza, [inaudible 00:00:58] or the bio building.
Mark Layton
 Right.
Chris Coulter
 Is where you want to jump in.
Mark Layton
 Yeah. So we click into here. I just didn't know if they were doing the header on that yet. That might be something we want to do.
Chris Coulter
 I don't think so. So before every demo, you have to go and change under that opportunities in the middle part, or when you're in the property. So go back into-
Mark Layton
 You mean go back into Plaza?
Chris Coulter
 Yeah. So in the opportunity-
Mark Layton
 You have to switch this from landscape to janitorial?
Chris Coulter
 Yeah.
Mark Layton
 I didn't know the previous screen if they were going to start dividing out buildings itself, but I guess it doesn't make sense, especially a lot of janitors branch out and will do anything the client asks them to do, even if it's exterior work. So from here we would go in and just take a look at the opportunities that are there. We'd go through the same process on the other stuff as far as contacts, issues, things like that we do on landscape. The big difference I tend to drill into site audits specifically because when you're trying to sell our CRM solution piece of this, this is a big one for janitorial companies that have to have quality control or audit out in the field. And we've got a lot of competitors out there that do this particular function by itself, very, very well, like OrangeQC, Jason's old company, CleanTelligent. So this is a big piece of it to dive into this.
So I don't know if you've changed the view on this at all. You can do audits by date, but typically I don't know, Chris, how you feel, [inaudible 00:02:45] before, see this is still pulling up landscape stuff. And I think that's something we need to clean up. There needs to be true... I wonder if there's a way to add, let me see if I can filter-
Chris Coulter
 Do that 1212 one. I think that 1212 one is janitorial. So Kim, are you looking for what we show in a demo, like the whole thing? Or are you looking for just the estimating process?
Kim Oswalt
 Probably just estimating because we might do... I know site audits and site inspections are a big thing in janitorial. So we might do a repeat of this call and dig more into that another time. The janitorial estimating focus for now came from the SEO guy on service Titans side really wants us to go after that keyword. So that's why we're focusing on that to start.
Mark Layton
 All right. So let me dig deep into that then, estimating in which platform? Are we talking about estimating as in a contract, or are we talking about estimating as in an ancillary type of function that they're bidding on, like what I call a tag job?
Kim Oswalt
 I mean, We might want to reference both if it's a strong suit of Aspire that we can do both. I know it's called out on some competitor pages as a pro, just that you're able to manage those two things from the same spot, but maybe contracts first. I imagine that's probably the first thing people would want to use it for.
Mark Layton
 Yeah. So for you-
Chris Coulter
 Sorry, Mark, to cut you off.
Mark Layton
 No, no, go ahead.
Chris Coulter
 What you're trying to put across is that I think would be the most beneficial message is 90% of the BSC's that I worked with, there is a handful of people in each of those shops that actually know how to estimate a job and estimate it correctly. So if you can have something along the lines of, we can put your secret sauce or whatever that you estimate on into a formula, that's what Aspire will do for you with its kits so that you can just break it down. Because a lot of people, if you just give them the square footage and then tell them any difficulties, numbers of bathroom, stuff like that, they can just pump out a quote just on pure product knowledge.But if you're hiring someone new, they don't know that. This is where the templates will make a huge difference.
Mark Layton
 And your janitorial RFP is a lot different than you'd see on the landscape side for just quoting a job. The RFP is going to typically contain four or five key components that are critical. One be the scope of work. Two would be the type of tenant-based instructor, including the square footage of the property because all square foot is not the same. So what I mean by that is, let's say the office building in St. Louis that we're in, let's say you had one company that managed that property, but you have Aspire on one side, but then you may have Chase Card Services on the other side of the building. And it's a call center and it's got 500 people and 20,000 square feet stacked 80 rows deep and that's heavy, heavy usage.
You can't really factor that into a standard square foot rate. You have to take out those little anomalies and adjust certain price structures. So when you're bidding a property in janitorial as an RFP, you're doing a square foot rate, but then you also have a factor of that square foot rate for supplies and chemicals and then also equipment. And then you have a couple other nuances, like day porter services, how many inside porters, how many outside porters? So there's a multitude of layers. So, one of the things that I may be able to do, if I dig through a couple of my old hard drives, I may be able to find an old Excel spreadsheet that breaks down how we would bid an actual job. And it's got all those fields and categories. And if I can strip out where that came from and just give you the blank template, that may help a lot.
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah. That'd be awesome.
Mark Layton
 Because there's a lot of detail, and Chris knows this from working as a distributor, a lot of times you get called in because the janitorial companies are notorious for hiring people that don't have any industry knowledge. And then on top of that, they don't get any trainees. They don't know what they're looking at. They don't know. It's imperative that you go walk a building before you bid it to understand what kind of dispensers are in the restrooms. Is an automatic roll towel versus a C-fold or a multifold towel. All those things make a big, big difference in your price point when you're bidding a job.
So beyond this template here for post construction cleanup, I think if you really want to hone in on the contractual side, we probably would need to do a template like it's coming from an RFP.
Chris Coulter
 I've talked to some of the solutions engineers and they're working on more templates for it. It's hard for them once they put a template in, they can't take it out. So they're trying to figure out what's the best one to look at. But Mark, if you go to the opportunity, I think under the janitorial commercial contract, that'll be more what you're talking about. You plug in the square footage and then it shows, I think, the light duty cleaning and all that stuff, let's see.
Mark Layton
 Yeah. Two times a week, three times a week amount of cleaning. I mean this still, I've had one janitorial solutions overview, then they totally correlate even with just this little bit of information, even though it's not a lot. They get what you're doing. You're basically taking their cookie cutter Excel spreadsheets that they calculate all this stuff in and you're actually throwing it into a production factor. So, that really resonates with them. The one thing it doesn't really hone in over here is it doesn't really factor in when [inaudible 00:08:47] square footage or how that breaks out the price per square foot in every janitorial bid, with the exception of two in my entire career has all been based on a square foot rate.
Chris Coulter
 Click on the light duty. I thought it did do that. Or go open it down, sorry. Go back one page. I think if you click the arrow to the left of light duty, Mark. Yeah. That one. The square footage is right there.
Mark Layton
 Got you. But I'm saying it doesn't show based on the total square footage of the property. It doesn't give a summary and then give a overall price per square foot, which has to be included in any RFP. There's only two properties I know that are cost plus out of all the companies I've worked for. One of them is AT&T Plaza in downtown Dallas, from my company ABM, they do cost plus. So it's just a margin factor on top of head count, but almost everybody else is a total square foot rate for the total square foot of the property.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay. And you're saying that Aspire isn't calculating it that way yet, but they're probably working on it.
Mark Layton
 Yeah.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay.
Mark Layton
 Let me see. I want to put it in a different screen. What else Chris, can you think of?
Chris Coulter
 You could do one of the tag jobs, because I think that's in there as well, if you go back. But essentially the main thing for our estimating is that we know your features as far as the square footage, how long it takes to do that stuff. And so when you plug it in, it calculates all that information for you.
Kim Oswalt
 And that was one of my questions is, I've seen demos on the landscaping side for takeoffs and kits and that sort of thing. But I was curious about on the janitorial side, and I can see some of the things that are set up here, vacuuming, drinking fountain, et cetera. But are those what would be commonly seen for a company? Is each company going to be a little different more so than in landscaping because in landscaping, it seems like most of those kits are going to be pretty common from company to company. Is that also the case in janitorial?
Chris Coulter
 It should be, because I mean you're typically cleaning the same type of stuff. I mean bathrooms, floors, entryways, that kind of deal. And then office cubicle areas. So it should be pretty similar. I mean obviously there's different types of buildings. If you're getting into dealing with warehouses versus class A office buildings versus hospitals, that'll be a difference maker, but for the most part cleaning's cleaning.
Kim Oswalt
 And there could be a template for each of those different types of properties, right? So it could rely on different takeoffs that you have a template for office building versus warehouse.
Chris Coulter
 For sure, because hospital has a way different standard set and this doesn't even bring into just disinfecting, like hospitals have very strict codes about-
Mark Layton
 Yeah, any type of [inaudible 00:12:05] medical office building is going to be a completely different type of bid than you'll see from a standard office environment. So I just found, and this came from my old company ABM so we'll keep that under wraps even though you're recording this call, but this is what we used to bid on. Now this is a $6 billion company, and we're using Excel. That gives you any inclination here. So we have multiple tabs. We have a pricing summary that gives the total, we have a job summary. Then we factor night cleaning from day staff separately. But just under the night cleaning tab, you're going to put in the square foot facility and you're going to put in all this detail here, who's responsible, but this is the equipment.
So I'm factoring equipment in. There's equipment costs that are amortized out. So I'm calculating what I'm going to need based on what I saw walking that property. Scroll all the way back up, because this is a super heavy spreadsheet.
Chris Coulter
 Have you shown this to the SEs by the way?
Mark Layton
 No. I just found it in my One Drive files from stuff that kept when I left.
Chris Coulter
 You really should.
Mark Layton
 Yeah, I will. And I may even send this to Jason. I don't even remember if I have the formula to get rid of this. I just don't want them to come after me. I think my non-competes up though, so whatever, but anyway, you'll put in the night staff based on the rate and the type of property. So I'll decide how many supervisors do I want? Like one supervisor, one lead, two supervisors.How many days they're how many hours they're working per shift. In this case, this building is a typical office building, which is a Sunday through Thursday clean. They don't clean on Friday and Saturdays. And then you put in eight hours on a Sunday because that's the day they go in and do a full detail clean of the property, including all the once a week items and the scope of work. And then they're coming in usually after the office gets out. Now this is obviously all prior to COVID. So a lot of companies have converted to day cleaning and stuff like that, but it just gives you an idea. And then you put in the wage rates. You load all this out.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay.
Mark Layton
 You can do first shift, second shift, third shift, you can do midnight cleaners. You can do floor staff. So here's the floor techs. Then you come down and you can factor in equipment and material stuff. And it's just going to calculate. And this is just one, I'm sure I've got another hard drive laying around somewhere that's got more from other companies I've used, but they're all pretty similar for the most part.
Kim Oswalt
 And the thing that Aspire would offer to somebody who was already using a really complex system like this, is just that it makes things easier and more standardized, but the ratio would all pretty much be the same as what you've got in this spreadsheet?
Mark Layton
 Yeah, something similar to this beccause like some jobs depend, like in this case, this was for multiple offices. So we might have factored in a vehicle for our district manager to go from location to location. There's just a lot of different nuances that you could factor in here. And there's all your bennies, if you've got somebody that's going to be paid benefits, there's just a lot of different factors in that.
Chris Coulter
 It should be when they build out the kits, it should incorporate if you're doing a flooring type kit, then obviously they're getting paid more than just a day porter would get paid. So it should take the legwork of that, rather than having to go to specific parts of the spreadsheet. If you put in that you're doing a floor job, it should automatically go to the section that you need of this. So it cuts out a lot of the guesswork and simplifies it.
Mark Layton
 Yeah. You would include all the equipment the floor tech would use and a floor tech, they're rare these days because they're hard to find, but they typically demand a higher wage rate because of the type of work they do and the expertise they have to have. Whether it's taking care of flagstone or granite or marble, just depends on what the job is itself. And then here I go in and factor all my equipment, log all that in, what my cost is, how many I need. So this is pretty typical for most. This one's a little more detailed than the other companies I came from. But I think you can get the picture. And here's where I was talking about the square foot rate. So this is the total square foot price for the entire facility.
Chris Coulter
 They can do that. You need to just tell them that though, Mark.
Mark Layton
 Yeah.
Chris Coulter
 Because that'll look good on a demo too.
Mark Layton
 Yeah.
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah. No, that's great. Great information. So a kit for janitorial would look like, say it was a kit for the floor care like you were mentioning, it would look like all the things for a floor tech and just the equipment.
Mark Layton
 Yeah. And I think you get specific. So here you've got it separated, like bonnet cleaning. That's a carpet clean, but there's two or three different ways to clean carpet. So you may have it just carpet clean and then inside of here instead of labeling it bonnet, which is basically using a floor buffer and a type of pad that goes underneath it, you may have multiple options that they could select from whether it's dry chemical or extraction, but it would-
Chris Coulter
 [inaudible 00:17:31] built that. Click into that. Click into the bonnet, or it doesn't matter.
Mark Layton
 The bonnet?
Chris Coulter
 You got to do the one below it, I think. Sorry.
Mark Layton
 What's that?
Chris Coulter
 You got to do the one right below it. Sorry.
Mark Layton
 Oh my bad.
Chris Coulter
 So, they just put [inaudible 00:17:56] in that one. Maybe look at the floor stripping one, because I think they might have done more of a kit for that.
Mark Layton
 So what Chris is talking about in here, like a full kit in this would not just be the labor factor. It would also be the bonnet floor pad and then the chemical used as well as the machine. If you were going to allocate a machine cost to that particular job.
Chris Coulter
 Which is a tricky thing because with the Moore's model, you typically don't want to do that. But I think that we're going to have to for janitorial. Try clicking that stripping kit one, Mark. See if that has more built into it. See, this is just a really simple one. So I don't know if they actually went into... Oh yeah, that one. No.
Mark Layton
 Yeah, they just got a labor factor. They don't have floor finish, stripper, neutral cleaner. So there's quite a bit that would go in here. But I think for demo purposes, at least on our end, I don't know. I mean, Chris, how do you feel? I don't know that it makes a massive difference because I can just speak to that. Hey, in the stripping kit we can include, besides the labor, all your chemical products that you need. [crosstalk 00:19:20] materials. You can build that in, but I'm trying to see if they have one in general that's better.
Kim Oswalt
 How would the complexity adjustment do you think ever get used in janitorial?
Chris Coulter
 Yeah, I do.
Mark Layton
 I do for sure. Because some nuances, so as an example, this is a class AA office building. It's a Rolex offices in Dallas, very high end, but the building is so old. They don't have water throughout the 20 stories. You have to go all the way to the basement to get water. So I would factor complexity on that. Every time they wanted to fill a mop bucket, they got to go all the way down and then go back up to the actual job location. That's a huge time factor. So I think that would actually be a very beneficial selling point in janitorial.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay. And that you would kind be able to determine how to change the complexity factor based on your notes from the walkthrough, right?
Mark Layton
 Yeah.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay. And I assume, I mean, we don't need to go through detailed walk through stuff today, but I imagine that Aspire is going to let you record square footage in the ways that somebody who's coming from other janitorial systems would expect. So by the floor type or not necessarily?
Mark Layton
 Well, it really depends. So in most cases, what happens when I'm getting an RFP to bid on a building for the actual contract. It's usually a one year or a three year term. If you're having to put in new equipment, you're amortizing that equipment over the three years. So it's a CapEx expense at the beginning of the contract. And then it's written off at the end of the contract. The funny thing is it's almost monthly because square footage changes and buildings on a monthly basis, we ask for what's called a rent roll. So the property management company, whether it's [inaudible 00:21:17] or any of the others out there, they'll basically send you a list of the tenant spaces that are occupied. And it's like a checks and balances system, like balancing your textbook at the end of the month where you're actually comparing that to what you've been billing them and then you update it. And then they do, we called it add or start stop form. Like if they add a tenant in the middle of the month, they would've to notify you that, what's a square footage. You'd have to go meet with a tenant. So there's a lot of typical little nuances and stuff like that. But for the most part, the square footage is going to get updated constantly, especially if they're using this in billing.
Kim Oswalt
 Got it. Okay. And then I had some notes here from looking at other pages that our competitors have and things that they call out as features that are beneficial. One of them is that you can create estimates using product surface types, traffic patterns and frequencies. So I think we've got the surface types accounted for in here in the kits. But in terms of the traffic pattern and frequency, is that something that one is important enough for us to be talking about? And two, how would we account for that in Aspire?
Chris Coulter
 I'll let mark take that.
Mark Layton
 That's an interesting one. Say the two terms you just labeled them again?
Kim Oswalt
 Traffic pattern and frequency
Mark Layton
 Frequency to me only applies to the scope of work. So when you get a scope of work in a contract, it's going to have, and I'm going to dig this up and I'll try to email this to you as long as print off a PDF and black out the names of my old companies so none of us get in trouble. But that's a unique one. So what typically happens is you have in the scope of work, you'll have daily items, weekly items, semi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual. And that's pretty standard in any scope of work. So, your smaller companies don't mess with two day a week cleaning locations or three day a week cleaning locations. They'll turn those bids down all day to the mom and pops. The other one that you mentioned, I'd be interested to hear Jason's take on that because I think that would really depend on who our audience is at the time we're working through a demo.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay. And I imagine-
Chris Coulter
 [inaudible 00:24:00] patterns really only matters towards supply. And then also floors deteriorating faster if it's a high traffic area.
Mark Layton
 Yeah. I mean, that would be the only thing, if you're trying to do some type of carpet program that's on or above what's in the standard scope, what we call an ancillary or tag job service or what they would call an enhancement in landscape. But again, that really just depends on the location and the property.
Chris Coulter
 I mean, you could build out a kit if you are doing a floor finish for a high traffic area, it's a better quality finish or something like that, or it's a more expensive product you're putting down for high traffic area so they could look at it that way. The thing is, it's all customizable to how you want to look at it. So we can answer all that, it's just a matter of how you want to do it.
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah.
Mark Layton
 Yeah.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay. And then I think I know the answer to this. We can't import floor plans or measure things in that way, right? That would be more of a [crosstalk 00:25:10].
Chris Coulter
 You can upload it, but there's not a [inaudible 00:25:14], I don't believe for what we're doing.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay.
Mark Layton
 No, because you're doing that typical floor plate, what they call a floor plate in a commercial building, that typically comes from the engineering company that measured it to update it from an architectural firm. That's a whole different ballgame, but you can upload that into... Because there's typically a hard copy that's emailed or sent out if it's requested. So you could just upload that document and associate it with the property itself.
Chris Coulter
 Yeah. So you probably just maintain it there. The nice thing with janitorial though, it's not like you're going to somebody's house or a property and then you're trying to figure out specifically how much grass it is like with the floor plans. You know the exact square footage of every room. So it's not as much of a guessing game as it is in the landscaping industry.
Mark Layton
 Yeah.
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah. That's a good point. And then as far as cleaning proposal types, this would again be based on templates, right? So you could have things, like I've seen the apartment move out, construction clean up, I think that was one that was in here. Things like that. Are there other common proposal types that you see?
Chris Coulter
 Floor cleaning, definitely carpet cleaning and then strip and re-coat or strip and new floor finish.
Mark Layton
 Yeah. I mean, that's all part of the floor care product. I think where you get into nuances is if you have hard stone care, that's a whole different type of entity. If it's flame cut granite in a lobby that you're polishing and resealing or marble or terrazzo, those type of hard surfaces are a whole different animal. That's typically when I was at companies, carpet cleaning is very competitive and very low margin. I wouldn't focus on that as much as I would this hard stone care. Because there's a lot of money in it.
Chris Coulter
 Window cleaning, duct cleaning.
Mark Layton
 Yeah.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay.
Mark Layton
 Power washing's a big one.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay. And those would be things that you would include? In the RFP you're going to see those types of things listed and then you would pull them into your proposal and Aspire based on templates that you've got set up. Is that how that would work?
Chris Coulter
 Yeah, pretty much.
Mark Layton
 Yeah. That's probably how I would do it.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay.
Chris Coulter
 It all depends. So that even shows it down there, if you scroll down on that proposal description, just the light duty cleaning, it even says like what they're going to-
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah. Got it. Okay.
Chris Coulter
 And that's why it says the flooring service is six times a year. I mean, you're probably not stripping and resealing a floor six times a year, and you're probably doing the carpets maybe quarterly. I don't know. That might be a high maintenance account if you're doing it that often. Did you ever do it that often, Mark? Every other month?
Mark Layton
 Yeah. I mean, it really just depends on the scope, man. Like if you're in and I've had it, that's where the crazy little nuances and I don't know that we would want to encompass every type of situation like that. I think we take it as a one off during the dialogue with the customer. But as an example, I used to do a building that had ESPN radio in it. They would actually live broadcast from the studio. So all the local sports people in Dallas would be at this one office. Well, IT guys run that whole hub because it's all streaming services. So they were very particular about where their server room was and making sure... And they paid for it, it's all extra, but like there's antistatic, what's called anti dissipative floor cleaner and floor finishes. And we had to do it monthly, but that's few and far between. Most of the time, big floors like that, IT centers, your clean rooms. You're doing maybe once every six months.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay. A couple of things Jason had mentioned just as call-outs, again for what Aspire's able to offer are pricing overrides, which I think I know how those work, that allows you to go in and adjust those prices if you need to lower something from whatever your standards are.
Chris Coulter
 You can raise them too with that as well.
Kim Oswalt
 Oh yeah. Okay.
Chris Coulter
 So it goes, it goes both ways.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay. And then in terms of configuring gross and net profit margins, how is that something that janitorial clients would be doing in here?
Chris Coulter
 So it automatically calculates that when you're doing the estimate for you, based on all of your production factors. So I don't know, did your spreadsheet, does it do that for you, Mark when you were with ABM?
Mark Layton
 As far as the margin?
Chris Coulter
 Yeah.
Mark Layton
 Yeah. I mean, there's minimum thresholds, but I will tell you, we look at margin, but not nearly as much as the square foot rate because that's what drives the competition and the market, and that's what the property management firms that run these facilities that select the winning bidder, that's what they base their decision on ultimately, is it comes down to price per square foot. So you got to bake in your margin in certain places, but I don't know if that makes sense, what I'm trying to say.
Chris Coulter
 Click the estimate next to the opportunity. So for what you're asking though, and then will you open up the far right side that's closed right now?
Mark Layton
 Yeah.
Chris Coulter
 So from what you're asking, when you do your estimate, it shows you exactly right there the net profit and gross margin. Then Mark, if you click those three dots and above all that, this one's already one. So you can't do it now, but it does give you an option to override that if you have the user-based authority to do that.
Mark Layton
 Yeah.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay.
Chris Coulter
 The cool thing that you could touch on if you're talking about that is you can set it depending on who's doing the estimating that it has to be approved before it goes customer facing.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay. Yeah, no, I can see that being another good feature to call out. Anything else? Like what else is particularly attractive about Aspire's estimating and proposal creation features for janitorial clients?
Mark Layton
 I mean, this is kind of simple, but I think the fact that it puts it in the cloud and is readily accessible, you'd be surprised how much of this is done and then printed off and live in an actual file in a file cabinet. And that's their history records for the entire life of the contract. And every time you do another manual piece of paperwork, whether it's adding something, taking away, it's always multiple copies. You've got to keep one at your desk. You've got to go put it in the master file in the filing cabinet in the accounting office. It's weird how they still do this paper process. But similar to landscape being far behind the technology curve, janitorial is even worse. I mean, it's brutal.
Chris Coulter
 I would say the big thing is that most people, once they estimate, then it's like that whole sheet's done, but with the way Aspire flows, your estimate then becomes your scheduling tool. And then that scheduling tool becomes the work. And then that ultimately becomes your invoice. So it processes all that information in one place, rather now you've got to go figure out how you want to go schedule it on your whiteboard or whatever. And then you have to go through who's available, do that. You can do that all on line and digitally, and then it'll create your invoice. Because a lot of invoices are done manually for a lot of these companies. So to streamline that whole process into your estimate ultimately becomes what you schedule and becomes the work ticket and then your payroll and how you invoice all in one thing. So that's a huge perk for sure, is streamlining that process.
Kim Oswalt
 Awesome. I think that might be all that I... Oh I did have one question. Another thing that I saw called out was some software that auto incorporates the ISSA 612 time and task standard to determine pricing. Is that a useful thing for us to mention? Is there any way that Aspire includes those benchmarks?
Mark Layton
 I don't know, to be honest.
That's a good one. I think it's probably a good basis. Ironically, I think market dictates that more than the standard set of production rates by ISSA, if that makes sense. And to expound on that, what I mean is so Dallas-Fort Worth is non-union labor. It's been the same square foot rate for the last 25, 35 years, within a certain range. If you're getting five and a half cents to six and a half cents a square foot with consumables, you're doing pretty good in this market, but then you go down to Houston and it's a different animal. If the building's more than 250,000 square feet, they have the option to be union for union labor. Well that leveled plane field, where ISSA standards would come in more frequently because the rates are all contracted based on the union pay scale. So it leveled the playing ground as far as the labor market goes.
Dallas-Fort Worth is heavily subcontracted, still you don't see a lot of direct labor where you're actually paying people and giving them a loaded wage with benefits. You're hiring a subcontractor because you don't want to be in the HR business having to hire 120 people for a 30 story office building. And then you go west coast, east coast, or union, and you have your little niches throughout the Midwest, up in Chicago in that area that are the same, depending on the location of the property. So I think it would be beneficial as a standard for sure, but I think it's such a crazy niche market depending on the geographic location.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay. So we could say that it's something that Aspire allows you to easily incorporate if that's what you want to use.
Mark Layton
 For sure.
Kim Oswalt
 Okay. Got it.
Mark Layton
 And you'll see a lot of the janitorial companies, they started the same way that you see these landscapers. It was a kid in the summer with the push mower now runs a 20 million landscape company 15 years later. And it's the same thing. Almost everybody I know, the companies I've worked for are all privately owned with the exception of the one that I just mentioned, which is ABM. Everybody else, they're running 40, 60 million dollar companies. And they started with their dad and they took over the torch when their parents passed away or whatever. They're still out there running the business. It's pretty wild.
Kim Oswalt
 Yeah, that's crazy. Okay. Well this was really helpful and I'm glad I have the recording to go back over as well. If you do get the spreadsheet scrubbed and would be willing to share it, that'd be great. Because I can go through that a little more in a little more detail, but yeah, I think this is a great start. I also, if you guys don't mind, will once this is written up, share it with you. That way you can gut check, make sure there's nothing in there that doesn't seem quite right or that we missed.
Chris Coulter
 Cool. Yeah, for sure.
Kim Oswalt
 Otherwise, we'll stop this."

 Well, I'll record it regardless. Okay. All right, Andy. So like I mentioned, we are working on this implementation guide to talk about the process. The people who have gone to through the Aspire implementation process, how it's a little bit different, the tips they need to be successful, et cetera. So I guess first off, Andy, could you give me a bit of background on your company? Size, customer mix, service mix, revenue, how you started it.
Andy Campbell
 Yeah, so we started the company ... I started officially in 2010. I started like a lot of owners in this industry, cutting grass for neighbors growing up in high school, middle school, that sort of thing. And then it flourished. Currently, we're about a $2-million-a-year company with plans to grow pretty actively over the next few years. Have about 25 team members. Our service mix, about, I don't know, 60% maintenance, 40% design and build, with a 50/50 mix of residential versus commercial clients.
Abby
 Gotcha. Great. I'm sorry. Did you just give me revenue in there?
Andy Campbell
 Yeah. Sorry. 2 million.
Abby
 2 million.
Andy Campbell
 We'll do 2 this year.
Abby
 When did you start working with Aspire?
Andy Campbell
 I believe I went live December 1 of 2019, so just under a few years ago.
Abby
 Gotcha. So implementation started-
Andy Campbell
 Would've been that fall.
Abby
 Yeah. Okay. So, what? September, August?
Andy Campbell
 Sure.
Abby
 Something like that.
Andy Campbell
 Something like that.
Abby
 Fantastic. All right. Had you been a part of any other big software implementations prior to your Aspire onboarding?
Andy Campbell
 So previous to Aspire we were on TimeScape, and then we were on LMN, and then Aspire.
Abby
 Can you talk a little bit about those processes and how Aspire was different?
Andy Campbell
 So TimeScape, at that point, I had somebody else that worked for me that did most of that implementation, so I can't really speak too much of that. LMN I did a lot of myself, and it was incredibly cumbersome. There were technically phone calls, I think, that you could have with some sort of what they would call CSM. It was a lot of watch-videos-and-do, and I personally just thought the whole system was incredibly backward. I actually never got 100% through implementation of LMN. So we used LMN for a season from a time-tracking and all of that, but not the invoicing or anything like that. So basically, it did our work orders and that was it.
Andy Campbell
 As we tried to implement more of it, I got more frustrated. I work with a consulting firm called The Grow Group. I made one of my consultants, [inaudible 00:03:34], get on a phone call with me with LMN. Because I don't think he, at that moment, believed just how silly and backwards some of the stuff was. So I made him sit on a phone call with me for about 15 or 20 minutes, and after that he goes, ""Yeah. Okay. You can switch to Aspire."" Because at that point, I was only about a million dollars in sales. So, we were trying to justify the cost ... Or a million-and-a-half. I don't remember. Of, does Aspire make sense cost-wise? LMN, at that point, was substantially less money.
Abby
 Right. Gotcha. So ...
Andy Campbell
 And I guess to finish that, my theory was, Aspire was and is kind of leading the way in the industry for software. So why spend three years on LMN when I know down the road I was just going to switch to Aspire, or something better than Aspire, and outgrow LMN? So, that's what we did.
Abby
 Gotcha. What drew you to Aspire, other than knowing that it was leading the industry? What specifically were you interested in in the software?
Andy Campbell
 I think I was most interested in the growth of the company, the size of the company, and the amount of money that was put into development year after year in the company.
Abby
 Gotcha. Great. So, how did your team approach implementing the software? I know that it is an arduous process.
Andy Campbell
 Yeah.
Abby
 Yeah. So, yeah. Can you talk about what the implementation process entailed for you back in 2019?
Andy Campbell
 So obviously we're a smaller company, so I kind of headed it up. Which was fine, worked. And then what I would do is, I would bring in certain team members, depending on what we were working on in implementation at that point. So whether it be my salesman, or the person in the office at that point, or whatever, to learn with me whatever part we were implementing and working on.
Abby
 Gotcha. How did that work for you?
Andy Campbell
 Overall, it worked fine. I mean, I don't think implementation went terrible by any stretch. So, I mean, to me, it was fine.
Abby
 Okay.
Andy Campbell
 I mean, I would've loved ... I'm not a software person. I know we need software, so that's why we did it. But it was not my favorite thing in the world to do, which has nothing to do with Aspire. Just not my deal.
Abby
 Can you talk a little bit about the pre-implementation work? Because I know that's a pretty significant time commitment. So can you talk about that, and then how you dedicated your time and time of the people that you pulled in?
Andy Campbell
 I mean, to me, it was just an appointment on the calendar. We just had to do it. It was just that simple. I wanted this program to work. I knew to make this program work we had to put the time in, and we just did it. There were no options. It was like any other appointment on my calendar. It got scheduled, and we did it.
Abby
 So you scheduled your implementation calls, but do you block out time? What was your process for-
Andy Campbell
 DO you mean for stuff in-between?
Abby
 Yeah.
Andy Campbell
 We just worked as a team and chipped off stuff as needed, knowing that in three days, five days, we were going to meet with our implementation specialist and we needed to have X done.
Abby
 Okay. So what was successful about your implementation process, and what do you recommend thinking about? Other people that are potentially considering Aspire, or people that may have signed contracts with us but haven't started implementation yet, what do you recommend they do?
Andy Campbell
 To me, this is going to sound really, really silly, but you just have to do it. I mean, just do it. You just have to devote the time, you have to get through the part that's no fun, and you'll come out, and you'll be happy that you have the program going. If you're going to make a bunch of excuses, it's not going to work. I also feel that you can't go into Aspire and think, ""Well, it should do this. Aspire should do this. Aspire should do this."" You need to figure out, ""Okay, this is how Aspire operates, so this is how my company needs operate to make the best use of the system."" Right?
Abby
 Mm-hmm (affirmative). Were there any concessions or changes to your process that you guys had to make as a team?
Andy Campbell
 No. Yeah. I mean, [crosstalk 00:08:49].
Abby
 Can you talk about that?
Andy Campbell
 I mean, it was real simple, when we did QuickBooks billing, to just put a number on something and just charge an extra 200 bucks for this little T&M, whatever. Now you have to go in, you have to create that T&M ticket, you have to do this. You know what I mean? Which, it forces you to be organized, but it is a pain in the butt at first to get used to that when you're used to just being, ""Come on, just throw an extra X on the invoice for, we picked up that branch today.""
Abby
 Right. Right. You actually have to think about what that actually costs.
Andy Campbell
 Right.
Abby
 I mean, given that you have, I guess, technically had a failed implementation, why do you think some implementations fail?
Andy Campbell
 Because of the client.
Abby
 Okay. Can you elaborate on that?
Andy Campbell
 I mean, to me it's just, they don't want to do the work. They just have a mindset that Aspire is not good for them, or they just don't want to put the work into it.
Abby
 Yeah. Not necessarily ... I mean, Aspire, sure. But implementations from a general perspective. Yeah. Like what, yeah do you have any other thoughts on, you know, why they might not be successful or why people might kind of bail during the process?
Andy Campbell
 I think it's a, I think, no matter what the process is that you go got to want to do it. And if you want to do it, you'll make it work. If you don't want to do it, you're not going to make it work. You have to want it. And if you want it, one way or another you'll find a way to do it. If not, if it's not that important to you or you don't think there's a benefit to it, you're not going to do it.
Abby
 Gotcha. So, what benefits or improved metrics have you seen in your team and process since you implemented the software? So, can you talk about-
Andy Campbell
 To me-
Abby
 Yeah. [crosstalk 00:10:49].
Andy Campbell
 To me, Aspire, one of its biggest things is just, it forces you to be organized. It forces you to have a ticket for everything. It forces you to close out tickets. It forces you to invoice everything. It's much harder to miss anything in Aspire than any other system I've seen. Also, obviously real-time data for hours on a project, or gross margin on a project, or job costing. I mean, all of that is immediate. When you go to renew a contract, you can immediately see the gross margin on that contract to see what you need to do.
Abby
 Awesome. All right. Yeah. Let's talk about your teams. How many people do you have at Campbell?
Andy Campbell
 25.
Abby
 25. Okay. So, yeah. Can you talk about how they received the software, and what benefits that you've seen in your team as they use the software, as you're reporting, as you're meeting about your data?
Andy Campbell
 I think any employee that wants to do well and wants to grow the company loves the software, and anybody that wants to stay status quo does not love the software. Most of the people that did not love this software probably still aren't employed here.
Abby
 Okay.
Andy Campbell
 There was no choice when we rolled this out. This is what we were doing. Like it or not, we're moving forward with it. I mean, there were two employees that I can tell you. One was my assistant, and I'm pretty sure Aspire drove to retirement just because of all the changes. Or that was one of the reasons for her retirement. And I had an account manager that went a different direction, and I think Aspire caused him a lot of stress, and that was probably one of the reasons he made a career change.
Abby
 Gotcha. Okay. Can you talk about benefits, like have you guys improved invoicing time, cash flow?
Andy Campbell
 Yeah. We've definitely improved invoicing time. We've definitely improved invoicing time. We've definitely improved payroll time. We've definitely improved just knowing our numbers, and knowing our profitability, and knowing when we're winning and when we're losing. Yeah. I mean, anything number-related, I think we've improved.
Abby
 Gotcha. Was there a moment or a situation where you were like, ""Wow, I'm glad that we switched to Aspire""? Was there a situation with a client, or a big project, or sales goal that you hadn't before?
Andy Campbell
 I think any ticket management, although ticket management is sometimes not-so-fun in Aspire. I think when you manage your tickets well, and it creates the invoice, and the invoice is then done in 30 seconds with a couple clicks, I think that's, from my side, one of the things that makes you appreciate switching. The other thing is, for me as the owner, to be able to click on any property and see where we're at margin-wise on that property, if that property is winning or losing, or that job, is huge.
Abby
 Awesome. What about estimating, job costing? Anything there?
Andy Campbell
 Yeah. I mean, to me, it has increased that greatly from a efficiency standpoint of putting estimate together. Also, it's obviously real-time of your gross margins and that kind of stuff. So let's say for commercial landscape maintenance project, we're trying to be competitive to break into a market, or a new customer, or whatever. To be able to see what that margin is and play with those numbers a little bit when we want to is obviously very helpful.
Abby
 Awesome. Okay. Great. Andy, as a landscape company owner, what topics and trends would you want to read about from Aspire in our newsletter? Are there any topics you want us to cover in webinars? What can we be doing from a content perspective to make you come to us as like a source for information?
Andy Campbell
 Software-related or not-software-related?
Abby
 I mean, it could be anything related to the business of landscaping.
Andy Campbell
 So, I mean, I guess from my standpoint as the owner right now, what I'm probably spending the most time researching in the industry is autonomous mowers and autonomous equipment. So I just think that's a trend of the industry, that I think there are probably a lot of people that don't want to admit that's where it's going, but think it is.
Abby
 Gotcha. Okay. Great. Yeah. Were you at Ignite80?
Andy Campbell
 Yes. Yep.
Abby
 Yeah. Did you find the autonomous mower section helpful? Was there anything that you were [crosstalk 00:16:26]?
Andy Campbell
 Yeah. I mean, it was okay.
Abby
 Yeah. Was there anything that you were like, ""Okay, they didn't talk about this, or ...""
Andy Campbell
 So to me, they were all kind of focused on the same type of machine. Where I think we're going to be more towards the Roomba-style, if you will, machines.
Abby
 Gotcha. Opposed to the [crosstalk 00:16:51]?
Andy Campbell
 I would've liked to see something like that represented, but ...
Abby
 Right. Gotcha. Okay. Do you currently have any autonomous mowers in in [crosstalk 00:17:03]?
Andy Campbell
 We do not. We will have some next year. We may purchase one this fall just to try, but we will have a few in our fleet next year on some accounts just to try.
Abby
 Are there any in particular that you're looking at? The Husqvarna, or the ...
Andy Campbell
 Husqvarna is probably the one I'm looking at the closest.
Abby
 The wire on the ground doesn't ... I mean, are you ...
Andy Campbell
 I don't love that. They now have some GPS units.
Abby
 So, that's what you'd be looking at.
Andy Campbell
 Yeah.
Abby
 Cool. Awesome. Anything else besides ... I mean, obviously autonomous mowers can help with any labor issues. I imagine that you are experiencing labor problems. What's your take there? How many roles are you trying to fill right now?
Andy Campbell
 As of today, only maybe one or two.
Abby
 Okay. But you're still having a hard time trying to get people in them. Okay. Okay. So, cool. Labor, robotic mowers. Anything else that we can help educate you on or report on as far as the industry goes?
Andy Campbell
 Not that I can think of.
Abby
 Okay. Awesome. Well, this has been incredibly helpful, Andy. Thank you for making the time. I know you're traveling.
Andy Campbell
 Sure.
Abby
 You're headed out next week? Or, no.
Andy Campbell
 No. This week.
Abby
 Later this week. Okay.
Andy Campbell
 Yep.
Abby
 I'm going to try and ... Because I'm working on the implementation guide. I'm also working on a blog post, so I'm kind of interviewing everybody and figuring out who will go where. But I will be emailing you some copy to just make sure that everything looks in line with what we discussed, and that you're comfortable with how I quoted you.
Andy Campbell
 Okay. The only other thing I would say from an implementation standpoint is, I would assume you know Mike Boeringa.
Abby
 Yeah. Absolutely. Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Andy Campbell
 So, he was my implementation person. I cannot say enough about his quality, his thoroughness, his patience, his understanding of the industry. So from my standpoint, that probably made my implementation, and probably why I'm just like, ""Do it."" Why I have the attitude I do about it, and have the attitude I didn't have for LMN. So the more Mikes you can have, the better. Or the more ways that Mike can touch more clients as you're bringing them in, in my opinion, the better. Because I was very, very impressed by the whole process working with him.
Abby
 Fantastic. Well, I will pass along those kind words, Andy. That's really, really helpful, and that's great to know. Yeah. I'll share that with him, but thank you so much. Actually, I'll share it with the implementation team. They'll be happy to hear that that one of their own is so highly-regarded by a client of ours. So thanks, Andy. I appreciate that.
Andy Campbell
 Totally.
Abby
 Great. Awesome. Well, safe travels, and I will be in touch.
Andy Campbell
 All right. Thank you.
Abby
 All right. Thanks so much. Take care. Bye-bye.
Andy Campbell
 Yeah. Bye-bye."

 Fair to me.
Abby Hart
 Fair enough. I'm not going to get into all the background stuff. Currently, what is Kasel Rocks customer mix, service mix and revenue Some of them we've talked about it in the last year.
Scott Lesak
 Revenues right around $1.5 million. Our mix is we're about 50% commercial, 50% residential shifting, our entire business model has already shifted to 100% commercial. For 2023, we are not offering any residential services anymore.
Abby Hart
 Wow, really?
Scott Lesak
 Yep.
Abby Hart
 For your residential clients, have you recommended other companies or what was your [inaudible 00:00:47]
Scott Lesak
 We haven't been doing residential returning service work. It's just been design build work. We started as at the design build company. We were still doing that and with where the financial position of the country is, we are really going after and obtaining distribution centers, warehouses, stuff like that for e-commerce work. It's virtually recession proof, I hate to say proof, but definitely resistant.
Abby Hart
 Actually, this is helpful because I'm also writing some SEO blogs. Hold on, let me make a note to ask you about obtaining more commercial clients.
Scott Lesak
 Absolutely.
Abby Hart
 Service mix.
Scott Lesak
 Service mix, we are I would say this year we're going to be looking at probably about 25% snow and ice, probably about 35% maintenance and then about 40% design build.
Abby Hart
 What sets Kasel Rocks apart from other landscaping businesses? Starting off with a real philosophical question.
Scott Lesak
 That's a great question I love answering. What sets us apart is our culture, our people. Our mission statement at Kasel Rocks is we are a group of like-minded individuals, passionate about bettering ourselves and our industry alike. Simply, we create peace of mind. We live that, we breathe that. Our people are first, our clients are second, our profits are third in that order every time.
Our people, we include our vendors in that pool, so we take care of our vendors, we take care of our employees. We pay full 100% of healthcare for our frontline workers. We have retirement with employer match at a company our size, and that's what sets us apart. We have high paid people that are valued and appreciate what they're doing. They do really high quality work because of that.
Landscaping, the service, the commodity that we provide is the icing on the cake. The root of what makes Kasel Rocks what we are is our culture and our people.
Abby Hart
 Knowing that and knowing how much the everyday work sort of affects your ability to create that culture, what role do you think technology and the right processes to work kind of affect the mission statement?
Scott Lesak
 We want to create peace of mind for everybody involved so that includes our people first, as I just said, and streamlining everything we can, giving them the most information, teaching them how they work, how these systems work, how our processes work. We have obviously, Aspire is our main system. We have a lot of processes within Aspire, but in addition to that, our operational processes are, I would be bold enough to say, unlike anything else that exists in this industry.
We have visuals that go along with them. We have training points that go along with those, train everybody on it. Those visual or the training points are directly reflective of what's in our contracts. Everybody is trained. We are 100% process-driven here and everything is uniform.
Abby Hart
 I love it, great. Scott, what software solutions have you tried before? Just turning back the clock, pre-Aspire, from the beginning of Kasel Rocks, what were you working on before?
Scott Lesak
 We never fully implemented any other software solution. Our VP of operations is really good with Excel spreadsheets and we had our business running off of spreadsheets and Microsoft Word, which worked really well. We had a very detailed bidding system that is very similar to what we use and Aspire today. We had a detailed scheduling system, detailed contracts, everything was really good. What wasn't good for us was the redundancy.
We had to go from bid to manually enter the contract, to manually enter the calendar and scheduling, to manually enter into QuickBooks then for invoicing. There was just a lot of redundancy with the manual entering that happened with that. We did demo LMN, we demoed their estimating and scheduling platform and that demo was enough to realize we didn't want to use that. We did not see any value in what that brought over our Excel spreadsheet that we were already using.
It's the same thing existed. There are redundancies and reentering information, and that was really our fullest extent. We knew a lot about LMN, we knew a lot about Service Autopilot, and we knew a lot about us Aspire when we were making our choice. Those were our three that we put on the table. Aspire was just like above everybody else there was no competition, not even a hesitation in our decision for which solution was going to be best for us.
Abby Hart
 What was a drawback with Service Autopilot?
Scott Lesak
 Service Autopilot, we didn't even get into a full demo because at the time we were doing a whole lot more build work than any maintenance work and Service Autopilot looked really good for maintenance and scheduling out routine service visits. It looked like it didn't have the capabilities to do what we needed to in the build side of things. Upon limited research, we eliminated that one pretty quickly solely on effect.
Abby Hart
 Piggybacking on that question, was Service Autopilot not great about one-off contracts? What was the reason?
Scott Lesak
 Getting into specific work tickets, even going on the enhancement level, not even all the way into the design build looked extremely cumbersome and it was very confusing of how you would actually be scheduling that stuff. Again, it looked like it was a very good solution. If we had a fertilizing application company or something like that, that really would've been a one that we were looking at.
Just with the ability to create tickets and be able to do multiple different things. The other drawback was the reporting that was I'd say all the time, the number one vet piece of Aspire is the reporting. If you don't get any more value out of anything else, it's worth every penny you pay just for the reporting that you can get out of it, let alone the rest of the package. Service Autopilot didn't have that reporting either.
Abby Hart
 Moving back to LMN estimating, you said it was a problem, what I have heard about LMN is that it seems like two different modular pieces. What was your experience of the demo?
Scott Lesak
 Really, I would agree with that, there was two different pieces. It looked maybe not worth quoting, but I'm going to say it anyway. It looked like it was a hybrid between multiple overhead recovery and dual overhead recovery methods and you can't combine the two. That does not work for adequate bidding. It relied heavily on their budgeting tool to get accurate pricing, which their budgeting tool was from a financial perspective really skewed. Your account in dollars instead of pennies in that.
Abby Hart
 Interesting.
Scott Lesak
 We had a free solution in place that was getting us as accurate if not more accurate results, so there's no reason to spend money on it.
Abby Hart
 You were working with highly sophisticated and custom contracts in Word and Excel spreadsheets. The main issue was the manual entry between all of these pieces. What made you decide, ""We need software for this."" What was the tipping point or the aha moment when you were like, ""This isn't going to cut it anymore.""
Scott Lesak
 The amount of time that manual entry took, it was me personally just looking at how much time I was spending. I would get great bids together, get great contracts together, get signatures on them, I have to enter all the information. I started timing how long it took me and some of them were two hours, some of them were four hours and it was just like, this can literally happen with the click of a button. With the right solution, we can save hours and hours, which is lots and lots of money over the time, the course of the year.
Thank you. Got a cup of coffee here. That alone, I'm a time guy. Time is money and everybody's time is valuable and just seeing the amount of time that was there. Another piece of this, which might not be the best for the interview, but we're really looking at a CRM as well tandem with that. We don't use Aspire for our CRM, so we can omit that for the conversation.
Abby Hart
 What do you use for your CRM?
Scott Lesak
 What is the name of it? Nutshell, I think it's called. It's like a map base, we have maps in there that pop up where we have all kinds of stuff and really I didn't put any of it together, so I can't speak too largely on that. If you ever want to have a conversation, I can link you up with our VP of business development, but it really is robust for what the way we approach sales.
Abby Hart
 Is there any integration or anything that between Nutshell and Aspire, do you connect the systems in any way?
Scott Lesak
 Not yet, we are just in the beginning phases with Nutshell. We have been using some of Aspire and then we had some, again going back to the spreadsheets with detailed maps associated and that was getting redundant. We do not have an integration yet, but I'd love to have a conversation with somebody if that would be possible.
What we produced just like everything else in this company is really pretty cutting edge. It might be a conversation worth having with somebody.
Abby Hart
 I know that CRM is not one of our strong points. Can you give me some reasons why you are using Nutshell in particular and why not Aspire?
Scott Lesak
 We have a very detailed sales process that has really evolved over the past about four months. This is relatively new for us, but we have a true sales approach to this. A lot of landscapers are not taking on a true sales approach, but our prospecting, our profiling, our level of data that we are accumulating on different sites, our geographic areas to put the roots together and everything, we really need map base with that first.
Essentially, you could think of it the VP of business development that developed the system said it's like fishing. We throw a line out, you casts it out, as soon as you get a bite, boom, now we're going to expand in that area. We're setting up micro locations as soon as next year because of that approach. We're going to have a couple of satellite locations around from that.
I will also fully humbly admit maybe it's our exposure in Aspire, but what we were exposed to and what we knew how to do in the CRM in Aspire just couldn't touch it.
Abby Hart
 Interesting, the map-based approach to targeting specific areas and potential commercial clients it sounds like.
Scott Lesak
 Yeah. That's also very well worth mentioning. This is 100% based on commercial work and distribution centers specifically. This is very niche based. It's not like just going after any landscape work out there. We have a well-defined client. We are going after distribution centers, industrial work, and class A offices, that's it. We don't do retail, we don't do HOAs, we don't do anything else. That is our niche, that's exactly what this is catered to do.
Abby Hart
 Interesting, I'll have to pass that on. Have you mentioned any of this? Wait, who's your CSM, Scott, is it Peggy?
Scott Lesak
 Peggy, yeah. Peggy's our CSM. I haven't had a conversation with Peggy in months. She's been talking to the other team. We have been having conversations with her, but I personally haven't. I have not brought any of it up to her.
Abby Hart
 I'll pass that on to her and I'm sure she'd find that useful if she hasn't aware of it already. You mentioned you were spending two hours, four hours, is that on specific contracts or would you estimate, could you estimate an amount of time you were wasting per week on some of this manual entry?
Scott Lesak
 Yeah, absolutely. I would say we're 50% more productive now. Literally, doubling our efficiency essentially.
Abby Hart
 Sorry, let me restate that. Do you have a sense of how many hours you in particular your team were wasting prior to going on Aspire?
Scott Lesak
 Let's call it 10 hours a week, 10, 15 hours a week, something like that. The big thing was, especially on the field side of this, now, getting into larger scale projects that have 15 line items in the proposal and we have to do a manual write up for each one of those line items, then we have to copy and paste that, write up into invoicing to make sure everything was congruent there.
That's an example of what it was. To fully quantify it, that's going to be tough, but I'd say at least 10 to 15 hours per person.
Abby Hart
 How many people in that pool you think were wasting that amount of time?
Scott Lesak
 At the time, we had two of us in there. Our approach to everything we do in business is proactive. We saw what was coming, we saw we were headed. We knew very well that 30 hours with two people would turn into 60 really quick and turn into 120, and that cascades really fast. Those are our highest paid positions in the company too, so that's a lot of money.
Abby Hart
 You I imagine were the decision maker who selected Aspire, who else was a part of the decision?
Scott Lesak
 We had had our VP of operations, who is also my right hand man. He and I made the decision together. He is very tech-based. He designed all the spreadsheet. He was the person who as much, if not even more than me was pushing for this. We need something else, this sucks at this point so we need to do something else. He and I made the decision together.
Then, right around that same time we brought a third person in for business development who was very active in making the decisions and set up and everything. He's no longer with the company, but he was very active in it as well.
Abby Hart
 What's your VP of ops name?
Scott Lesak
 Kevin Heilman, H-E-I-L-M-A-N.
Abby Hart
 Can you describe your process for when you were selecting and kind of comparing LMN and Service Autopilot Aspire? How long was that process? What did it look like? What were you doing? It sounds like you had demos of LMN. I don't know, I can't remember if you said you had a demo of Service Autopilot. What was that process?
Scott Lesak
 We wound up not demoing Service Autopilot. It was the entire process I would say was probably about two years. We had called Aspire well before we were ready for Aspire, and very politely were told that we weren't quite ready for Aspire yet and we understood why. That was when we demoed LMN then to see if that was a fit. We didn't like it, that wasn't our fit.
At that point in time we started to make up our mind, let's just build up to we're ready for Aspire, we can continue to drag our time out a little bit because $500,000 is not a lot of money to make up the difference to get us to where we need to be. Then, when we were actually ready to make the decision, that started in August 2019. We started had some, Dave Gallagher's been a long time mentor in front of mine.
He and I had a couple conversations, we started working with him and he fully solidified that after everything we saw, everything we were looking at, this was the right solution for us. With his support, with his backing, we made the decision really quickly.
Abby Hart
 I've talked to David as well. What sorts of questions were you trying to answer during this process and what sorts of resources other than David, did you seek out at this time?
Scott Lesak
 We didn't really seek out any other resources than David. We like to create in our company rather than replicate. One of the biggest deciding factors for us after getting the recommendations, seeing a full demo. Corey [inaudible 00:18:32] is another Penn State landscape contracting graduate and Kevin and I both are, so that helps a lot too. No, all joking aside, we saw the customized ability of this and how much wiggle room we had to fully run it the way we wanted to run it and fully grow into it.
John Gold told us this that we were buying the F-350 crew cab Platinum Edition pickup truck and when we're done with implementation, we're only going to have a two-wheel drive F-350 that's not all the way there and we can connect the dots to get to what we actually bought. Hearing stuff like that, I was like that is a line that resonates with the landscape industry. Good work there, John, absolutely. Now, I'd say we're probably somewhere around an XLT model at this point. That was one of the biggest draws to me.
Kevin's a computer guy, he loves computers. He loves playing with this stuff. He really heads off our Aspire now and is actually transitioning into a role that's going to be over 50% of his job function at this point. All of that stuff together just really made us want to come over because we saw that we could keep our proprietary nature of our company without having to mold to what constraints of another system might be.
Abby Hart
 It's interesting that you say that because so much of what it sounds like the implementation team and to a certain degree customer success is that Aspire forces you to have better processes because you have to mold yourself to Aspire. You're saying that you're able to customize it. Can you talk a little bit more about what you mean by customizing?
Scott Lesak
 Absolutely, with that, I agree with that statement 100%. Aspire definitely does force you to process drive your company. However, it doesn't have to conform to one set thing. Yes, you obviously it's got to be in line with what Aspire does. I'm not saying it's 100% customizable, but within Aspire it's not like you're going to run your routine maintenance this way.
You're going to do your build projects this way. We have the flexibility to pick and choose. Really, for our process development, we were already a process driven company that we didn't have a lot written down. We didn't know a whole lot. We just had enough guys that have been here long enough that we were doing things exactly the same all the time, and with Aspire it forced us to get it written down.
It forced us to change our approach and from being able to say, ""We're going to do this maintenance this way, we're going to do this maintenance this way, this no contract this way, but this one this way has gotten us to, no, this is the one way we do landscape maintenance. These are the two ways we offer snow."" That's it, no other options. This is what we sell. It has built our sales team, it has built our forecasting, has built our financial team, everything about that.
It forced us to laser focus and keep it simple in the best way, which is really what all business owners need to do. The complexity I see in a lot of these businesses, specifically large companies too, people getting into the $50, $60, $70 million range of how do you operate with that complex, it doesn't need to be that complex.
Abby Hart
 Can you talk a little bit about the things that you do that you have customized or of bent Aspire to your will, let's say?
Scott Lesak
 Yeah, absolutely. Templates are the big one. Having our estimating templates. We have fully formatted our estimating templates into tandem with checklists as well. We don't necessarily have to check the boxes, but what we offer is in that template and we go through, we have to bid everything out. We don't miss anything because of that. If there are some of our elective services that are not going to be part of a certain contract, we just delete the line item.
It keeps everybody accountable. It's a new form of accountability. It has also gotten us to the point that we are evolving into a single estimator in the company-wide. We don't want multiple people estimating because of getting how specific that is. When we have multiple people estimating Aspire has helped a lot get rid of a lot of the wiggle room, but I'll come up with one number. Kevin will come up with one number and operations manager will come up with one number.
We have all that dialed in and we communicate around how those bids get put together, but one person's entering them, it's a lot more uniform.
Abby Hart
 Awesome. You already mentioned reporting is far and away the thing that you value most in Aspire. Can you give me the top three reasons that you chose Aspire?
Scott Lesak
 Absolutely, reporting, accountability, and consistency.
Abby Hart
 We talked about accountability in estimating and consistency and estimating. Are there any other areas that you'd say, are there any other functions or areas of the company where you're really seeing the benefits of these three things? I don't know if I'm wording that clearly enough.
Scott Lesak
 I think I get it.
Abby Hart
 Other than this [inaudible 00:23:52] where are you seeing the benefits of reporting accountability and consistency?
Scott Lesak
 Reporting has been great to really monitor efficiency of the crews and we've been watching our crews get more efficient. We have our finger on that pulse, we can see exactly what that means, we can see exactly what they're doing. Last year was the most influential year for that because that was our year that we experienced 20% to 30% price increases in a lot of areas. We had our finger on that pulse from June timeframe on.
We were incrementally raising those prices rather than getting to January and saying, ""Crap, a lot of this is costing us a lot more money now we need to raise our prices."" We already knew it, we already were doing that and progressively did it throughout the year. The accountability side of things, it keeps our whole team accountable. Operations managers have specific duties, sales managers have specific duties within the system.
We have a controller in place that does all the month end work and he keeps any of the stuff that might be missed and has that accountability aspect. A lot of things that as an owner that you would ask questions about or not sure who's doing it and have to double check that somebody else is getting it done is right in front of you. You know how to get it done, build the right process around it, you're managing the process instead of the person and it all happens just very fluidly.
Abby Hart
 Consistency, aside from estimating any other areas?
Scott Lesak
 The consistency I would say that's company-wide is not position-specific, not function-specific in Aspire, but going back to what I was just talking about is simplicity and keeping everything simple and figuring out this is how we do it here. Now, everything's consistent, we deliver the exact same, not the same but the exact same solution to everybody that we're working with every time. It starts in Aspire. I guess it starts monitors and ends in Aspire when you really think about it.
Abby Hart
 Perfect. Now, I wish I'd asked this earlier, we had talked about the problems you had with Service Autopilot and LMN. Were there any other main differences that we didn't touch on?
Scott Lesak
 I would love to touch on the price because that's the biggest argument I hear against Aspire and that'll be my biggest argument for Aspire. You get what you pay for. We purchase high quality equipment, we invest in high quality people, we invest in high quality training, and that's what makes us succeed. The lesser price of the other two solutions was a red flag for me when we went into this.
That lesser price also raised the question of are we truly getting extra value out of Aspire that warrants that different pricing? We did monitor that, we did inspect that and make sure it was worth the extra, we were getting the value out of the extra price and that really, that was a deciding factor for us for sure. I'd rather spend more money on the right solution than pinch pennies and not get the right solution.
Abby Hart
 Ballpark, what's the price difference between the two for your particular company? Scott, do you remember what [inaudible 00:27:11]
Scott Lesak
 I do and I know LMN just raised their prices drastically, so my information's not going to be adequate. It was $300 a month when we were looking at it and I'm working with a couple of companies right now that are switching away from it and they're I think in the neighborhood of $700 or $800 a month plus having to pay extra money for job costing now.
The element is literally going to price themselves out of the market pretty soon. They think they have a solution that's competitive and it's not, and they're trying to chart a competitive price now and it's not going to work.
Abby Hart
 How many times more, you don't have to give me what you're paying for Aspire right now, but can you say whatever X Aspire cost versus?
Scott Lesak
 Probably about four to five times, but you're getting 10 times the value out of it.
Abby Hart
 It's giving me soundbite after soundbite, Scott, you're a pro at this. Is there any feature or functionality you miss about your old process?
Scott Lesak
 Not really, no. I mean we continue to develop and we're adding new features like CRM like we talked about and stuff like that. However, there's nothing that we missed there. It was a learning curve for six months and getting a field guys fully trained and on board, and telling them like, ""This is the way to the future."" Then actually listening to what they were saying and like, ""Crap, we're not giving you the tools to success. We got to change stuff on our end too.""
Getting through that was really challenging, but now that we're through it, everybody really likes it and everybody is warming up to it. We still have one guy that's on the fence but he's warming up to it too.
Abby Hart
 What's the biggest stress on your job?
Scott Lesak
 Biggest stress on my job? Man, that's a great question. I don't look at my job as stressful. I enjoy what I do. I enjoy leading people, coaching people, helping people grow, that is my job. I don't do anything with operations I don't sell. If I had to pick one stressful thing, it would probably be financial. The ups and downs of this year specifically, we had a very robust growth goal that we are far from meeting because of economic constraints on the build side.
As well as a little bit of turnover with sales team that we are processing through to get the right fit in place, which we finally have now and actually just got rid of the last piece of that puzzle yesterday. If I had to pick a stress that would be where it comes from. I have always loved designing things and building them and that was what got me into landscaping and that's still what my job is today. I'm designing and building a business now. I'm not designing and building landscapes anymore. Aspire is an integral part of our design and our foundation for the build of it as well.
Abby Hart
 This is a two-part question. What are the biggest obstacles to achieving those goals?
Scott Lesak
 The biggest obstacle is me. I got to get past yourself, got to look in the mirror, and once I figure something out about me in the mirror, I got teach the rest of the team, lead the rest of the team to that, have them look in the mirror and see what they can change about themselves. We all collectively need to understand businesses do not grow, they're inorganic, a business cannot grow. People within the business grow and cause the organization to succeed to higher levels.
Abby Hart
 You mentioned there's some economic factors that are happening on the build side. What are you seeing right now?
Scott Lesak
 Very slow decisions. People going with lower dollar contractors rather than paying for quality, they're paying for price and rightfully so. I wouldn't fault anybody for that right now, we're expensive. Just the slow part of the build side, the slow decision making as well as just the challenges of training team members. Build takes years to perfect maintenance, takes weeks to perfect. It's really from the scalability aspect of multiple levels, a better course for us we go into the commercial maintenance.
Abby Hart
 Actually, I'm just going to jump to some of these commercial, can you talk a little bit about how you are approaching obtaining more commercial opportunities like new contracts and also renewals? We'll start with new opportunities first.
Scott Lesak
 Yeah, absolutely. New opportunities, full-time position. We have a two-person team working on that, the VP of operations and well, currently just the VP of operations as of yesterday, we're going to be replacing the sales manager that was underneath him. He's out prospecting looking into, we have a robust list, we have 754 prospects right now that we came up with over the past month and a half. We look for the exact fit that we want.
We look for the sites that we need in geographic areas and we start getting in there. We utilize tools like CoStar, which is a platform for real estate investors and real estate sales and commercial real estate. And that platform gives you building ownership, building management, contact names and information. We're digging in on a deep level, getting to at least somebody that can get us the decision maker and most of the time the decision maker there.
We build out maps that are associated with that. We put in data to the system with all the names and we go through and start contacting and continue to contact until we either get, ""Hey, leave me alone or let's talk.""
Abby Hart
 You have a two-person team, that's interesting. I know you're in peer groups, Scott, and you also act as a consultant to other businesses, is that true?
Scott Lesak
 Yeah.
Abby Hart
 Is this something that a lot of other companies that are in commercial do or is this something that you're like, ""Well-
Scott Lesak
 What we're doing is what other companies do on steroids. We have a formal system behind it and our sales system is very influenced from sales systems outside of the green industry. A lot of the green industry, even with very proactive companies are still somewhat reactive in the sales. We're proactive going after these people, going after these people. He called me back, now I'm going to go after him and not focus on anybody else.
It's still a reaction to the proactivity. We don't stop the proactivity, we just continue to reach out, contact, and really push and drive it. It's a very good system to obtain fast grow.
Abby Hart
 Let's chat about renewals. What's your approach to, and this doesn't have to be commercial, I know that you have a lot of experience with residential contract renewals. If you could talk to both, how do you approach building more loyal clientele, but renew year after year?
Scott Lesak
 Sales and renewals are directly every single person in the company's function. Every single person has some sort of piece of that puzzle. We treat our crew leaders the way they need to be treated like they know their stuff because they do. We trust them to go out there and do the services. Our crew leaders are encouraged to talk to our clients. Tell them when they're finding things, tell them when they drive through the fence in the backyard if it's residential.
Tell them when they nick the building or hit a car with a rock when it's commercial, that stuff happens every day, that is part of our industry. So our crew leaders are the front line of that communicating with the client. From there, it goes into the account management level, which in our company right now at the hybrid position of operations manager and account manager, a single person.
That account manager should be reaching out to those clients at minimum once a month just saying, ""How's everything going? We found this on your site. Here are some enhancement opportunities that we found because these plants are dead and we want to replace them. Here's what it would cost if it's in your budget."" Just having that constant communication, creating the peace of mind, which is our mission.
Once we get to the point that we are at renewal, anybody that's value based client always renews with us. Anybody that's price-based does not, and we get rid of the price based people then and that's good for us. We welcome anybody that's going to buy on price, you're welcome to leave our portfolio, that's no problem because we deliver value, we deliver quality.
Abby Hart
 How much do you rely on reviews or word of mouth or referrals? How does that [inaudible 00:36:31]
Scott Lesak
 Pretty heavily, we advertise. We have some really good Google reviews. We have two one-star Google reviews, which one is 100% accurate and the other one's fictitious, and we have 45 star reviews. When you read through the list, you can really pick through that caters more to the residential side, the commercial side of things. We have referrals, we have a program with existing clients that they're happy to talk to new clients and have phone conversations, email interactions.
Just tell exactly what the experience is with us. I guess in a way that is a review, but as far as a Google review or formal review, we found that it's almost irrelevant in the commercial circle. Word of mouth is huge. We get good work from word of mouth and that has always and will continue to always be the best referrals. However, to aggressively grow and to have a very rapidly, I mean we're going from a $1.5 million split company to a $3 million maintenance company for next year.
To obtain that amount of growth in a completely different atmosphere, we're literally having to sell about $2.5 million to make that happen within a six-month period, and you can't do that by word of mouth. That doesn't work. We continue to build up and welcome the word of mouth. On the commercial side of things specifically though, the word of mouth that is most beneficial is getting into different geographic areas. X company has a location in X town.
Who's the manager of that site? Can you make an introduction? Can you talk to them about our experience?"" We have them communicate within their own organization, telling about the experiences with that they've had with us.
Abby Hart
 Can you talk about snow and ice renewals or contracts?
Scott Lesak
 Yeah, absolutely. Snow and ice is one of our prided areas in that is going to wind up being the tool that allows us to grow as fast as we are growing. With snow and ice, again, we are 100% value-driven on that. We have state of the art, really expensive equipment we're running metal plus plows, big wheel loaders, the best spreaders on the market. We will be investing into liquids for next year.
We have a lot going on the snow side. We are science-based, we are performance-based. We are working with 24/7, 365 facilities that need to pay for what we are doing. The sales process, it comes down to 100% education. Snow and ice with the right clients understand that it is not a price base, you pay a cheap price, you're getting a cheap product. We go in and we educate. We tell them why our price is where it is, what service they're going to get out of it.
We have books printed that have all of our equipment pictured in there and what it does, what the functions are that we hand out in addition to explaining what the stuff does. We make promises that we deliver on them. Snow and ice, the only time we don't renew is if we choose to walk away, we do not lose snow and ice contracts.
Abby Hart
 How do you staff that up? Do you guys use a lot of subs? What's your snow and ice?
Scott Lesak
 100% self-perform, we don't use any subcontractors. This year's the first year that's the case. Last year we had one subcontractor left and this year we're using no subcontractors whatsoever. We scale up seasonal employees from other seasonal businesses, roofing contractors, exterior construction, excavating operators, black topping roofers, farmers. All those people don't work when it's snowing and they all really like to work. That's how we build up our seasonal labor pool.
Abby Hart
 When do you start that?
Scott Lesak
 July.
Abby Hart
 Has it been the same crop year after year? How long have you operated on this? You start recruiting in July.
Scott Lesak
 We retain most of who we have on the seasonal side of things. I don't have a good percentage for you, but most of who we have, we do retain. We added 10 pieces of equipment to our snow fleet this year, which effectively doubled the size of our snow operation. So this year's the first year that we really needed to find a substantial amount of people. It's a trial and error phase at this point. It's going really well right now, we'll see how they show up, we'll see how everything goes.
Really, to operate effectively to snow and ice management, we want to deliver the snow and ice management service to all of our green season clients. It's a lot easier to perform if you're performing on a hundred sites for green season with the same staffing, you could probably only service 15 of those for winners. We want to be able to service those 100 sites and ramp up, get three to four times the employees for the winner on the seasonal side of things when we need to. That's the concept, that's the plan right now. This year is going to make our first year really putting that into execution.
Abby Hart
 That 10 pieces of equipment, that is an investment.
Scott Lesak
 Eight skid loaders and two-wheel loaders. It's a lot.
Abby Hart
 That was a purchase, not a rental?
Scott Lesak
 We lease everything. We do five-year leasing on our snow equipment. We don't want to own it. The new equipment's garbage, too many computers, too many electronics. We want them under warranty and when they're done with the warranty, they go back. What makes a business valuable is the system is the process, is the way you do work.
Not the trucks, not the equipment that anybody can buy those anywhere, but how you do it and how you get it done is what makes it valuable. We've recognized that, we've seen that, and we're building the value of our business on the business side, not on our asset side.
Abby Hart
 Wait, you lease all of your equipment so landscape and snow and ice?
Scott Lesak
 No. I'm sorry, we lease our snow equipment or heavy iron as we call it skid-steers and above are leased. Then, mowing equipment, trucks, and stuff you do too much damage on those to lease them. When you them back in, you'd wind up buying it anyway so we just finance those to buy.
Abby Hart
 Yeah, that I was like, ""Wow."" I had a question for you about, how is technology supporting all this growth on the snow and ice side, Scott specifically Aspire or whatever?
Scott Lesak
 It's been great. People always just talk about how talk snow isn't in Aspire. My answer to anybody that asks that question is, ""You don't know how to set up snow and Aspire because it's a breeze."" Having the ability to train, that's part of our processes that's built into the visuals of you're doing this service, here's the ticket you have to clock into under your snow ice management when we're in snow mode and everything.
It's built into the training, it's built into everything that we're doing, and it's been huge. It takes away the manual work of having to go through, we were doing paper pen and paper, job site monitoring, production monitoring before, and it's taken that away, we don't have to go through papers to do invoicing. We have to go through enclosed tickets and then the invoices are ready.
Abby Hart
 Same question, but on the landscape side, how does technology help support gathering new opportunities and also renewals?
Scott Lesak
 We have all the data we need to see within the reports when specifically getting to renewals if we need a price increase for that renewal or a price decrease, which has happened as well in Aspire. We look at that and we will do that adequately. We are in business to make money, but we're not in business to be greedy either. If we're making too much money, we see that and we mark that down. If we're not making enough money, we mark it up.
We have clear communications with the clients about what that is and even have shared reports with them to say, ""Here's exactly what our numbers look like, this is why we need this price increase."" We haven't done that for a decrease yet, but as far as new business and actual operations in green season, it's scalable. We can have multiple people in there running it. We can have multiple crew leaders doing different things. We have operations managers doing different things.
When we're ready for a second operations' manager, third operations' manager, it's all scalable. Plus, second location is on the near side of the horizon for us after we get a little bit further along financially. Once that happens, we literally duplicate everything we have in the system and add another branch to it, that's it. From that, the scalability aspect of that is just huge.
Abby Hart
 How many employees do you have?
Scott Lesak
 15 full-time. Then we're looking at about 30 with the seasonals for snow this winter.
Abby Hart
 Wait, you scale up to 30?
Scott Lesak
 Scale up to 30, yep.
Abby Hart
 Wow, this has been incredibly helpful. I feel like you've given me more than 50 minutes. I could sit with people all day and go to their operations and not get this level of insight.
Scott Lesak
 Well, if you like that, you should come to our operation. [inaudible 00:46:08]
Abby Hart
 I would love to, unfortunately I'm in Ohio.
Scott Lesak
 We're a little ways away.
Abby Hart
 Actually, that reminds me, are there any people that use Aspire that you think that somebody like me should talk to? Are there any good customer stories or any people you that you met at Ignite or in another peer group that you know or really running Aspire really well are?
Scott Lesak
 There's a couple. Greg Cole, I don't know if you ever talked to Greg Cole.
Abby Hart
 I've never met Greg Cole, but obviously my team has, and we have a testimonial from him.
Scott Lesak
 He and I talk a lot, share information, and the way their company operates on Aspire is really good. He does a lot of high end build work up around the $10 to $12 million range, I think is the size of his company. From a build aspect, he's a really good guy. Justin White or any of the White family from K&D. In my opinion, they're crushing it. Then Craig, what is Craig's last name? Craig [inaudible 00:47:18] from Snow Care and Grounds Care in New Jersey.
He does some good stuff specifically for snow. He and I have been going back and forth about the way we have snow set up. It was pretty much 95% identical before we started having conversations. Craig really has some good setup and Aspire as well. I can rack my brain a little bit further, I know there's a lot more than that.
Abby Hart
 This is incredibly helpful.
Scott Lesak
 Tricia Jenkins too, she's awesome. I talked to Tricia all the time from LandCare and she's the director, Aspire with them, and she's a wealth of knowledge.
Abby Hart
 I feel like every time I talk to somebody from LandCare, my brain is just the way they run things over there is just-
Scott Lesak
 Well, Mike Bogan's one of my mentors.
Abby Hart
 Really?
Scott Lesak
 Tricia was actually at, we just ran a leadership retreat a couple weeks ago in North Carolina, and she was at that retreat. I got to spend some really good time with Tricia and they're just incredible.
Abby Hart
 If you think of anybody else, Scott or anything else that we missed, please let me know, but this is great. Thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate you devoting so much time to helping us at Aspire and just giving us your insight.
Scott Lesak
 Yeah, absolutely, happy to help. Part of our mission statement is bettering our industry and all of these conversations help do that so I'm happy to help anyway I can.
Abby Hart
 Thanks, Scott. [inaudible 00:48:52]
Scott Lesak
 My pleasure, Abby.
Abby Hart
 Take care.
Scott Lesak
 See you, bye.
Abby Hart
 Bye-bye."

 ... Perfect. Okay great. So David, just to give you ... And I don't know why my computer's being a little weird right now. Just to give you a little bit of a rundown. What we're doing is a bit of a competitive campaign with current LMN users.
So you used to use LMN, correct?
David Amigo
 For a short period of time, yes.
Interviewer
 Okay. Okay. How long were you on it?
David Amigo
 We went live June of last year?
Interviewer
 Okay.
David Amigo
 So and then until February 28th of this year.
Interviewer
 Gotcha. Okay. So I mean, what we like to do is sort of talk a lot about the pain points that you were experiencing as a user of LMN. What we would do is write a success ... Or like just ... We would write a customer story and feature you on the website and kind of talk about the problems you were experiencing as a user of another software.
We wouldn't mention LMN by name on the story on the website. But we would mention LMN by name in internal sales collateral.
David Amigo
 Got it.
Interviewer
 So I don't believe that anything outward-facing, with the exception of maybe an email or two would say LMN, but you would-
David Amigo
 I don't care. It's fine.
Interviewer
 You don't care. Perfect. David, can you still see me?
David Amigo
 Yeah.
Interviewer
 Okay perfect. I don't know what's going on with my computer right now. Okay so yeah. Let's chat David.
Can you tell me a little bit about your company, how it got started, and what brought you to landscaping?
David Amigo
 Yeah. So history of the company and how I got involved. I'm actually the third owner of the company. And it's kind of timely, right? Because the company was born out of Hurricane Hugo.
Interviewer
 Oh wow.
David Amigo
 Back in 1989, Hurricane Hugo came through this area. Two guys named Gary got chainsaws and started cleaning up. G&G Landscape.
Interviewer
 Oh wow.
David Amigo
 That's how it got started. I've been told that about a year later, they had a falling out. One of the Garys left and they started telling people it stood for ""Green & Growing"", which I thought was pretty clever.
There was a gentleman here, his name was Richard. Super, super successful sales guy. And he was really responsible for building the company up. And he actually purchased the company from the remaining Gary approximately 16, 17 years ago.
The Gary that remained, the owner financed it for him. Richard really was born in the industry. Really knew his stuff. Like I said, he was just a super, super sales guy and he really built the company up to a larger entity.
And back in 2017, I purchased the business from Richard. Richard had a few health problems. He loved the company. He said he wanted to continue working, he just couldn't handle the stress of owning the business which was good for me because I don't have a landscaping background.
Interviewer
 Oh really?
David Amigo
 But I do have a small business background, yeah.
Interviewer
 Gotcha. Okay.
David Amigo
 And so I bought the business in '17. Richard stayed for about a year and a half and then he actually moved to the coast of South Carolina. And we've always been focused on high-end residential construction, that's the bread and butter of the company and we do a really solid job of that.
We're only here in the Charlotte market and I think we have a really strong name for quality. And we had a very small maintenance business that was depleting, from the time I talked about buying the business until I actually bought the business, Richard wasn't very interested in the maintenance side of stuff and it was all residential.
I actually love maintenance. I love commercial maintenance. And so we've been really trying to get better and diversify the company. And so I was fortunate enough in 2020, to find the ACE Group.
I've always been involved in peer groups. I spent 15, 16 years in Entrepreneurs Organization. And in 2020, the ACEs held their Grow Conference here in Charlotte and I attended. And that really just started the ball rolling for me to go ahead and leave my entrepreneur group and join the landscape-only peer group.
And that's really been a difference. Because I've been visiting different companies around the country and really learning how they operate. And so, when I walked in the door here, I didn't know anything about landscaping. I didn't know anything about the industry really.
My previous business was related, I was a general contractor previously. So there was some relationship but not really. And it really opened my eyes to a lot of things. And I will tell you, so we have four core values here.
First is quality. Second is exceed expectations. Third is long-term relationships, which means not just clients but vendors and more importantly employees. And the fourth one is solo los mejores, which means ""only the best"" in Spanish.
And we have a large Hispanic workforce so they really relate to that. And to be honest with you, on our construction side, we're really known as Seal Team 6.
Interviewer
 That's great.
David Amigo
 Right? When you have a project that's of high quality, we're kind of one of those go-to names in the industry here in Charlotte. And so, that really is where we've made our name.
Ever since going to the peer group and visiting other companies, I came up with four observations that I've noticed at all these companies. First of all, I think there's a common theme, right? There's this theme that somebody started a company when they were in middle school, high school, college or something. They started cutting yards and the next thing you know it's a real business and then they were a million dollars, and then five, and then the next you know they're 20, 30, 40 million dollars.
And I think you hear that throughout the industry, which I think is awesome. And I kept asking myself, ""I don't know. Why can't we just be another chapter in that story?"". Right? It's happened in Dallas, it's happened in Minneapolis, it's happened in Denver. It's happened here in Charlotte, actually. The Loving Group is real caught up and Mike, I think he started in high school, you know?
Interviewer
 Yeah.
David Amigo
 And so, I just kept saying to folks, ""I'd like to be another chapter in that story."". And so, as I went to other peer groups, I think there were four observations that I made that every one of the well-run peer group members has.
And we use those observations with our core values to really focus our team of how we should operate. And so, the first one is knowing your numbers. And I'll talk more about that because that's really where Aspire comes in.
The second one ... And about knowing your numbers, I will say, it's not just the owner that knows the numbers. Everybody in the organization knows their numbers and they're different. Depending on what your position is, depends on what number is important to you. And so, all these companies, they were very good at knowing their numbers.
Number two is they all ran very clean and efficient operations. Physically and communicatively. Right? So the guys are clean, the trucks are clean, the shop's clean, the equipment's clean, and the communication's clean. If somebody goes out and sells a job, there's not a lot of distortion to the guy who's actually installing the job. It's just very clean.
The third thing I noticed is every single one of these companies treats their team well. They compensate them well, they're appreciative. There's a fun environment. They're certainly trying to help team members grow. So they have a great culture.
And then the fourth one is that they were all profitable and some of them are super profitable. And I have a theory. If you do the first three, if you know your numbers, if you run a clean shop, if you treat your team well, the fourth one just magically appears. And if you have the fourth one, it's really easy to do the first three.
Interviewer
 That's awesome. I love that. I mean, and that all makes sense. Hang on. Just a second, David.
Oh. One thing I wanted to ask. So you mentioned you have a big Hispanic workforce. How many employees do you currently have?
David Amigo
 We're around 50.
Interviewer
 50? Okay, great. Yeah so let's get into sort of the technology piece.
David Amigo
 Sure.
Interviewer
 So you've been a part of G&G since when?
David Amigo
 2017.
Interviewer
 '17. Okay. So was it already operating on a software system at that point?
David Amigo
 No. They used Sage Accounting, paper, and some Excel spreadsheets, and Word documents.
Interviewer
 Okay. So when did you realize like, ""This isn't going to work. We need some kind of technology.""?
David Amigo
 Before day one.
Interviewer
 Okay. So you knew you were going to move them to ...
David Amigo
 We knew there was a lot of technology that hadn't yet been implemented.
Interviewer
 Okay.
David Amigo
 I mean, this is a joke but it's not a joke. The phone system I inherited was two cordless phones from the 90s. And so, you froze on me for a second. I don't know if you heard that. Oh. You froze again.
Let me know when you're back. Are you back?
Interviewer
 I'm back, yes.
David Amigo
 Okay. You froze twice on me. I don't know what you heard or didn't hear.
Interviewer
 You started talking and then you froze. So, yeah.
David Amigo
 Oh. So the phone system I inherited was two cordless phones from the 90s.
Interviewer
 Ah, great.
David Amigo
 And we didn't have a copy machine. Let alone a plotter to do plans.
Interviewer
 Right.
David Amigo
 Yeah. Now, we knew we had a lot of technology to install. And we went through iterations. And I have a very strong IT consultant which is good and bad, right?
It's good because we can do lots of things other companies can't do. It's bad because we were able to cobble a lot of technology together ... While, we had a lot of technology, it didn't really integrate together.
So I'll give you an example, right? First thing we did is we went from Sage to QuickBooks. But we went to QuickBooks Desktop. At some point, we switched to QuickBooks Online because we had other technology that wouldn't integrate with the QuickBooks Desktop. And Intuit kept saying that they weren't going to support desktop, but it still exists so I think they were just lying but I don't know.
We wound up using TSheets before TSheets was bought by Intuit.
Interviewer
 Okay.
David Amigo
 Which was awesome because we had an iPad and it had facial recognition on the clock-in, clock-out. And if somebody punched in and they didn't recognize it, I'd get a text right away or an email right away.
Hey, here's a picture and this is Jose Martinez and we don't recognize him as Jose Martinez. I can look immediately and either acknowledge, ""Yes, that's him. He's wearing a hat and glasses."". Or, ""Hey, that's not Jose. That's Joe Smith clocking in for Jose, what's going on here?"".
And there might be a legitimate reason that that happened. Jose left early, he forgot to clock out, he was clocking ... Whatever it is, you know?
Interviewer
 Gotcha.
David Amigo
 So we had inventory software. We wound up putting in GPS. We had a lot of things but they weren't integrated. And then, on the estimating side, we started with field services from Intuit because that was a native product for QuickBooks.
And we pretty quickly went to Jobber and Jobber had some things that were spectacular about it but they didn't really do the job costing.
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 So if you go back to knowing your numbers, we didn't have the technology to know our numbers. We spent a very long time evaluating multiple platforms.
Aspire was one of them. We spent four and a half months evaluating Aspire a few years ago. This is pre-service type, okay?
Interviewer
 Okay. Mm-hmm. Right.
David Amigo
 We looked at Service Autopilot, we looked at Boss, we looked at Asset, we looked at LMN. We couldn't find the solution that was going to give us what we currently had. Because we cobbled together these other pieces that were kind of important to us.
And we couldn't figure out how to get what we already had and not spend more money. We were going to have to spend more money and get less. So we couldn't figure it out.
And so, it turns out ... I actually go to church with a gentleman who's on the board of directors of Boss, Integra.
Interviewer
 Okay. Mm-hm. Yeah.
David Amigo
 And he implored me to go ahead and take another look at Boss. And they promised us, ""Hey, we're not taking private equity money. We're focused on our clients. We're going to get all these things done."". And I think that was important to us.
Because from our perspective, there really wasn't a solution out there that did all the things we wanted to do. Or at least integrate with other packages that did, right?
And because we have this great IT consultant, we wanted to be involved and have a voice and be part of the solution. If you're going to go test something, we wanted to be a beta test site, right? Because we'll give you honest feedback. We're not afraid to say, ""Hey, this works. This doesn't work."". We're, ""Help us out. Let me show why it doesn't work and let's figure it out together."".
We're more than willing to invest the time to do that kind of stuff. Because I think it makes us better and I think we're a benefit to the software company because most landscape companies, they just want to work, right? They want to just install the next job because you don't really make money by being feedback but in the end you really do, right?
If I can get the software to be better, even if it's better for everybody, right? I can make more money.
Interviewer
 Right.
David Amigo
 But so can all my peer group members make more money.
Interviewer
 For sure.
David Amigo
 And so, we try to look for people that we can partner with. And we thought we had this connection and ... I'll be honest with you. I was very wary of the private equity. And-
Interviewer
 Why is that?
David Amigo
 Because my experience in private equity is they don't know the business. They're just looking at numbers. I had a really bad experience ... My previous business was in modular homes. And my main manufacturer was owned by three private equity companies.
At one point, they went bankrupt. The private equity took [inaudible 00:17:35]. They made the dumbest decisions. They never listened to us, right? And they made the dumbest decisions. And they're so big, they just don't care.
And that's kind of the feeling I had of ... Private equity comes in, they have a game plan, they're not listening to us. Listen, I'm small peanuts, right? They can write their money off and keep moving. For me, this is everything we have.
And so, honestly I was really trying to avoid it because I was like, ""It's going to be a bad experience. We're not going to have a say. You're going to shove it down my ... "". It's like Salesforce, right? Salesforce just shoves it down your throat. Indeed, they just shove it down your throat.
""This is the way we do business. Oh you want to talk to somebody? Sorry we don't do that."". And so, we were looking for a partner more than we were just looking for a vendor.
Because we knew we didn't have everything wrapped up. And so, we had some really good calls with Boss and they made some promises. And, they didn't come through with any of their promises.
Interviewer
 Okay.
David Amigo
 There was this three-month period of, ""Hey, we're gong to have this ready for you and we'll link it."". And we had a call. And we were growing and my whole team recognized, this was May of last year, 2021, my whole team recognized, ""It's a problem. We have to change software. We need job costing information."", right?
And we had a very bad call with Boss. And I'm like, ""All right. We've got to do something. LMN seems like it's a reasonable solution."". Because to me, LMN and Aspire have very similar methodologies about how the software works with job costing and building estimates and building hours and material and all that. And frankly, there's a huge price difference between LMN and Aspire.
And to be honest with you, our first go-around, I think Aspire did a really poor job of highlighting the differences between the two.
Interviewer
 Ah. Okay.
David Amigo
 Okay? We couldn't see what the difference was. Legitimately. We used the same methodology and LMN's a third of your price, not even, right?
Interviewer
 Right.
David Amigo
 And we're like, ""Okay."". So literally, the first week of May, we had the bad call with ... Or it was the last week of April, we had the bad call with Boss. First week of May we had a call with LMN. And June 1st, we were up and running live on LMN.
Interviewer
 Oh wow. Okay.
David Amigo
 Quickly. Yeah. Because we knew we needed it. We have good resources here and my team works really hard. And this was the conversation we had, ""Hey guys, it's the end of April, May, okay? This is the absolute worst time of the year to switch technology."". And everybody was like, ""Exactly! Let's do it!"".
We're up for the challenge. That was the attitude my team had. 100 percent, we're up for the challenge. And we did. And it was incredibly helpful to get on the job-costing cycle. But one of your questions that you had said to me was, ""When did you realize that you outgrew LMN?"".
And I would say it was probably two, three months into. We realized that we had outgrown LMN. It was from reporting features, it was ... LMN's really like two different softwares cobbled together.
Interviewer
 Okay. Can you be more specific about [inaudible 00:21:53]?
David Amigo
 So I'm not the IT guy, but this is my understanding. There's the whole job-costing module and then there's this whole scheduling, timekeeping module. And they're really two totally separate databases and there's some syncing that happens between the two. But it is not seamless and it's not good.
The reporting features in LMN stink. And actually what we wound up in is the scenario I was trying to avoid. LMN also has private equity money from my knowledge. And we thought ... I thought, ""Oh I was special."". Because I had a connection to a C-suite executive. And I thought, ""Surely, they're going to listen to my concerns and they're going to help us fix a few things."". I got absolutely nowhere. Nowhere.
Interviewer
 Okay. Wow.
David Amigo
 And so, my team was really struggling. I don't have all the ... I know on the maintenance side, my ops manager on maintenance absolutely hated LMN. I mean, hated LMN.
Interviewer
 Do you know kind of exactly what their issues were with the?
David Amigo
 Some of it was things that took him two steps in Jobber were taking ten steps in LMN.
Interviewer
 Oh. Okay.
David Amigo
 Whether it was scheduling or setting up a contract or logging something into the job. Whatever it was ... I distinctly remember, ""This is such a pain in my butt. Because I used to be able to click once or twice, now I click 10 times to get the same action done."".
And I know, we had all of our contracts in LMN. And so, all the material. Like say I have 200 maintenance clients and they all get fertilizer, but they each get a different quantity. But it is already built in there. We couldn't just run a report that said, ""Oh! You need to buy X amount of fertilizer for March."".
Interviewer
 What do you have to do to do?
David Amigo
 What's that?
Interviewer
 What would you have to do then to understand what you needed to purchase?
David Amigo
 I think he had to review every contract somehow and get it exported ... It was just a big pain in the butt. And so, I was ... I don't use the software as an executive. I don't use it as much as my folks that are actually managing crews or on a crew do every day.
I look at some high-level reporting but I don't necessarily go into route scheduling or material ordering or any of that. And I'm not the one closing the books at the end of the month. And so, I had a lot of pain on my team.
And that happened to coincide with the ACE Summit which we had in Beaver Creek Colorado last year. And Aspire is a sponsor and had sent folks there. And just at a coincidence, I wound up having breakfast with Cris.
And I don't remember exactly how she pronounces her last name? Poggi?
Interviewer
 Poggi. Mm-hmm. Poggi. Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 And it really wasn't much about the software at all. It was just in general and I knew I had these pain points. And I was like, ""You know, Chris, I think I need to go ahead and re-look at Aspire. We're really struggling with LMN. My team's not happy. I think we need to take another look."".
And at the time, when we left off, I think it was right before Service Titan had purchased Aspire. And most of the work that was being done was how it looked. It was just a scan of the software. Which really, I wasn't concerned about the scan, I was more concerned about the functionality.
And so we started looking at it and we had a list. We were pretty good ... Not me, but my IT guy was really good about, ""Hey, these are the things we're currently doing that are working that we need. These are the things we haven't found which we really want."". And then there was another section of stuff.
Maybe it was, ""We really have to have."" and maybe it was, ""Really want to have."", right? And it really looked like Aspire made a lot of progress in coming across stuff. And so we started investigating and it didn't take us long. We pulled the trigger pretty quickly.
That conference was in November, January 27th, I think, 29th, I had said, ""Yes."". We were live less than a month later. Slightly less than a month later. So we might have investigated it for a few weeks. And we were actually very pleased with the progress that Aspire had made. And I'll be honest, I've been thrilled most part of being able to work with Aspire to get things fixed.
We're in dialogues right now, there's certain things that are just not working.
Interviewer
 Okay. Namely?
David Amigo
 What's that?
Interviewer
 Namely?
David Amigo
 So I'll give you my big one, right? I need to have a forecast of what my construction department's going to do this month.
Interviewer
 Okay.
David Amigo
 Revenue, labor costs, material costs, subcontractor costs, right? The dial doesn't work. Let me tell you why the dial doesn't work. If there is a job that crosses over a month, the way the report's doing the calculation, it's not accurate.
Interviewer
 Got it.
David Amigo
 Now, I will tell you the data is bad. Travis will tell me it's not bad. It just needs additional work to get it to be accurate. He's got a point but it's not usable, right?
Interviewer
 Right.
David Amigo
 It's not good enough. And we're wasting at least one to two hours a week of our most critical resource to throw it into Excel and match it up and get accurate information. And so, we are actively working with Brian and his team to try to get a solution to that.
And I'm not upset that it's not working at this point. I'm just happy that they're working with us to fix it. Now we might have this conversation in three months and I'm going to tell you I'm upset because at this point it should be fixed. Because that's not a preference item.
Right? It's not like, ""Hey, I wish this dial or this button wasn't on the bottom left."" It was on the top right. You know?
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 This is a critical piece of data that impacts every design bill company that has jobs that cross over one month.
Interviewer
 Right.
David Amigo
 Now, our maintenance forecast is very accurate. Because all the jobs pretty much happen in one month, right? It's scheduled and so we can figure that out.
So what I thought was going to be a problem because you guys are private equity money is actually I'm very pleased that we're getting a lot of response and we're working through it. Now, like I said, I might change my mind if we don't eventually get the results but so far I've been very thrilled with what's going on.
Interviewer
 That's great. So let me think back, David. So you've talked about reasons that you flipped over to Aspire, things that weren't working well on the LMN side. Were there specific functionalities or ... I mean, you obviously had this conversation with Chris and then kind of did your research to compare where Aspire was when you originally looked at them to where it was now.
Were there any specific features or functionalities or any other factors that really pushed you over the edge into Aspire?
David Amigo
 Yeah I mean, we knew the reporting and the job costing. LMN is the minor league version of what Aspire is. And I would tell you that if you're a relatively smaller company than we are, right?
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 If you're less than a million dollars or a million dollars, LMN might be a great solution for you to get started, right?
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 We're probably, knock wood. I think we might be just shy, less than nine million this year.
Interviewer
 Oh great. Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 So we're at a size where we got more going on and more people and that data really has to be there for us and we don't have the time. If you're doing a million dollars, there's only a handful of jobs you're probably doing during the month.
Interviewer
 Right.
David Amigo
 When you're doing 9 and hopefully 20, 30 someday, right? You got to be able to scale.
Interviewer
 Right.
David Amigo
 And I don't think LMN's a scalable software because we outgrew it. But I don't think Aspire matters to be honest with you. Now, I think if you were at a million dollars, you could use Aspire. You're just probably not getting the value out of it. But Yellowstone's on Aspire so obviously you could scale with it, right?
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm. For sure. Absolutely. Awesome. What would you say are the main differences? And we kind of talked around it, but if you were to kind of give the elevator pitch between the main differences between LMN and Aspire, what would you say?
David Amigo
 It's the data that's at your fingertips. I think it's just way easily accessible in Aspire versus LMN. That would be the biggest one I would tell you.
Interviewer
 Okay. Anything regarding let's see ... Okay. You said the data. You mentioned that reporting is bad in LMN. What about it is bad?
David Amigo
 Yeah it was terrible. LMN's reporting is terrible. There's just no two ways about it.
Interviewer
 I mean, because I've never played around in LMN. Is it the accessibility of it? Is it you don't trust the data? What is the ... ?
David Amigo
 You just can't get the data. You're just very limited about what you can do. And it's just not going to produce the information you need.
Interviewer
 Okay.
David Amigo
 Now some of it is you just can't get it. Real job costing, you just can't get. Like I said, that scheduling time module doesn't really talk to the estimating module, right?
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 So it's very difficult for you to say, ""Hey, this is what we estimated the job at. And this is what it finished at."".
Interviewer
 Got it. I mean, I know it's early days, David. It's been what? Seven months, eight months. No. Seven months.
David Amigo
 Yeah.
Interviewer
 Are there any sorts of measurable changes and improvements that you can point to? Close rates. Is there anything that's kind of attributable to your ... ?
David Amigo
 The biggest thing I could tell you, because I had this conversation yesterday, I believe it was. My ops manager who absolutely hated LMN, he's like, ""You've got to see all this data I'm getting on our maintenance properties that I'm able to see how we're performing. I can spend my time on the worst-performing ones to figure out why and solve that."".
So it's a direct bottom line impact because if we realize ... Typically, bad-performing jobs are one of two causes. That's it. There's only two causes for a bad-performing job, right? It wasn't estimated properly. Or it's not getting executed properly, right?
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 Now, you could have both. But those are the only two things that go on, right?
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 And so, he's really able to dig in and find out if a property's not performing, why. And make the changes. And so, every industry consultant will tell you, right? Get rid of your contracts that you're losing money on.
Interviewer
 Right.
David Amigo
 Right? And get more profitable. So our greatest, most important resource is labor. I don't want to use labor to not make money.
Interviewer
 For sure. Absolutely.
David Amigo
 And so, yeah. I would tell you that having that data right in front of our face is really, really important. It is helping on the sales side. We're still ... I describe Aspire for us as in Star Wars with the death star, right?
It doesn't look real pretty. And we're not getting the full functionality of it. But it does work, right? And so, we realize that we have several more levels to go that we're really getting value out of the software.
Interviewer
 Okay. Great. Let me think. Okay so is there ... If I were to just say ... Like, actually you know what? I'll save it for the end. Is there any feature or functionality that you actually miss about LMN or a previous software but LMN specifically?
David Amigo
 No. But I will talk about Jobber yes. 100 percent.
Interviewer
 Oh really?
David Amigo
 Yes.
Interviewer
 Okay.
David Amigo
 Yes.
Interviewer
 So you don't miss anything about LMN?
David Amigo
 No.
Interviewer
 Okay.
David Amigo
 No.
Interviewer
 [inaudible 00:36:43]
David Amigo
 Well ... I'll give you one that you can run up the flagpole. I know where it'll go. I really, really miss the price.
Interviewer
 Well of course.
David Amigo
 That's the one thing I really miss about LMN, right?
Interviewer
 I don't blame you.
David Amigo
 We've been in talks with folks at ... The customer portal in Aspire is just not good. It's not good at all. They know it.
Interviewer
 Yeah.
David Amigo
 We know it.
Interviewer
 Yes.
David Amigo
 We're actively trying to help them fix that.
Interviewer
 Was it better on LMN? Do you miss that?
David Amigo
 No. LMN might have been better than Aspire but it still stunk.
Interviewer
 Okay. Fair enough.
David Amigo
 Jobber's was phenomenal.
Interviewer
 Okay.
David Amigo
 Phenomenal.
Interviewer
 What about it was phenomenal?
David Amigo
 The ease from the customer's side, right? Customer gets an email. Click on the link. There's no passwords. There's no nothing. Takes them right in the proposal.
We actually worked with Jobber on this for optional items. Okay, so I'll give you an example, right? Let's say a very common one throughout the industry. You're going to have a client that's either going to put sod down or they're going to put seeding straw. They're not going to do both, right?
Seeding straw is the less expensive way to go. Sod is the instant impact, right?
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 So we could put that in the proposal, that you get to choose one or the other. The client just clicks and it says, ""Choose A or Choose B."". It chooses one. It changes the price of the overall contract and changes the deposit amount because we take deposits, right?
And so, it's a one-stop shop. They just go in. They click what they want. They hit ""approve"". And hit the button to pay. We don't have to send them an invoice. There's none of that.
Interviewer
 Wow.
David Amigo
 I mean, it is spectacular. There's no two ways. The LMN stinks and so does Aspire. It just stinks.
Interviewer
 Yes. I mean, I know that's something that Product is actively working on.
David Amigo
 We know they are.
Interviewer
 Yeah.
David Amigo
 My contention is, it's too far out on the roadmap. Our number one I'd say entity that we need to please in the industry is our clients. I mean, you certainly want to keep your employees happy but you've got to make it easy to do business with you.
Interviewer
 Right.
David Amigo
 And I would make the argument ... And I had this conversation with other Aspire users. Somebody had told me this and I believe this to be true. That 80 percent of the interaction with their client is through the customer portal.
Because they're a maintenance customer and then ... So that's a representative of us. And they're having to go through some really crappy software [inaudible 00:39:42].
In this day and age, have you ever used Expedia?
Interviewer
 Yes.
David Amigo
 Okay. Have you ever gotten the email, how was your flight? There's a happy face and a sad face?
Interviewer
 Yeah.
David Amigo
 Right? Did you ever respond to that?
Interviewer
 I have actually.
David Amigo
 I have too. But guess what? Send me a survey when I got 15 questions. Delete.
Interviewer
 Right.
David Amigo
 Delete. Delete. Delete. Oh, you want a happy face or a sad face? I can do that all day long.
Interviewer
 For sure.
David Amigo
 Make my life easy! You know and I look at that, I'm like, ""We live in an Amazon world. Everything is instantaneous and everything is easy."". Click, click, click. I'm done. Okay?
When it's not intuitive, people just shut down. And we have clients all the time ... We've lost jobs because the portal's bad. Both LMN and Aspire that has happened to us.
Interviewer
 Well that's good to know. And, we already know. So that's good. But yeah.
David Amigo
 Yeah. But you've got to fix it quickly.
Interviewer
 Yes. I agree. I fully agree David. Okay, let's get down to these last questions. What's the biggest stress in your job?
David Amigo
 For me, it's right now we're growing and we're evolving a lot. And we're ... I wouldn't call us a very well-run company just yet. And so the biggest stress for me is really developing the numbers for each person in the organization of how they should manage themselves. And getting that.
And that's really our next level of evolution with using the software.
Interviewer
 Gotcha. So that's your big goal then. Are there any other goals that you're trying to reach in the next year or so?
David Amigo
 Oh we've got a million things going on. I have a gentleman who works here who likes to tell people when we're recruiting them, it's not often that you can get in on the ground floor of a 30-year old company. And that describes us pretty well.
Now I don't believe we're on the ground floor anymore. I think we're probably on the second or third floor because we have made a lot of progress. But we're really evolving quickly. And I have a little bit of satisfaction today because we have made so many improvements.
Now, I think we've more improvements to make than we have made. But at least I can look back and say, ""Hey, at least we got that done."".
Interviewer
 Yeah. Are you guys stuffed up? Is that a goal of yours? So your big key numbers for each of your staff or crews or what have you.
David Amigo
 Actually, we're one of the few companies that for the moment we're okay with staffing.
Interviewer
 That's great.
David Amigo
 We don't have a lot of holes. Now I think that's going to change because we've made some changes and some really great additions on our sales team. And I think that's going to put some incredible pressure on our operations team, which is great. That's kind of what we want.
But we seem to be staying one step ahead of it at the moment.
Interviewer
 That's great. What are the biggest obstacles to you achieving your goals and how will Aspire help you attain those goals? It's a double-barreled question there.
David Amigo
 I mean, listen, I think our greatest resource, which in turn, would be the greatest obstacle is the right people. It's not just people, but it's the right people, right?
And I do think we've created a culture here. And what I like to tell people, okay, so, we are not a finished product. We are very much a work in progress. And so, we're not a good environment for somebody who wants to come to a place that everything's just running right.
We're always just searching out, ""Oh. We're not doing this very well. How do we fix that?"". So if you don't have that mindset, if you get frustrated of like, ""Well that should have went better than that."". Or ""That's frustrating."". We're not a good place for you.
And we're very open and honest about that. I told you about running a clean operation. We are far from running a clean operation. Our shop is not where we'd like it to be. We've outgrown our office. We have a modular construction trailer and we've outgrown that.
We got 20-something people just in management operations, not direct labor. So we're a little bit on the heavy side for indirect labor because we're staffing up as if we were a $15 million company. And so, we're in the process of trying to draw plans up to build a new ... Well, finish out a building here.
And we have ... Take it from being a shop building to being an office building. And so, it's about the right fit. And that's the obstacle, right? How do you continue to put people in place that fit the culture, that understand what's going on, that enjoy it, that have fun, that work hard. And are industry-knowledgeable, or if they're not industry-knowledgeable, how we can train them.
We're not a great company for training at the moment. That's one of the things that we certainly have to get better on. And I think we've got a long list of stuff. There are things that we are better at and things that we're worse at. And we try to talk about that and things that we're getting good at. I'll give you an example.
So we were horrendous at onboarding somebody in management.
Interviewer
 Okay.
David Amigo
 He was like, ""You just show up."". All right. Figure it out. So I think we got really good at that. We had shirts available and business cards and computers and a gift and a gift for the spouse and we took them out to lunch.
And so we're actually really good at onboarding a management person right now. Even though I found that sometimes as we got bigger, it slipped a little bit and we didn't perform as well as the second person that we onboarded in the right manner, right?
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 And so we're constantly working on that and so we talk about that. Like, ""What are we good at? How do we stay at that level? What are we really not good at? How do we fix that?"".
And so, you got to have people that are willing to have, what I like to call adult conversation. There are times when we got to look at each other and go, ""Man, we stunk."". It's not personal. Doesn't mean you're a bad person. Doesn't mean I'm a bad person. It's just, we really botched that one up.
Not everybody wants to do that. Not everybody can do that. And so, I tell you our obstacle is to continue to find the right people and make sure that we're keeping them. It goes back to treating the team well. We got to make sure we continue to treat them well.
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm. How can Aspire help you do that and reach other goals?
David Amigo
 Well I think that-
Interviewer
 Or how do you see Aspire helping with that I guess?
David Amigo
 Yeah Aspire's biggest benefit to us is having everybody know their numbers. I used to run around here ... This is really true, this is three years ago. I started running around and I had to question everybody in the company. I would just have this conversation. I'm like, ""How do you know you had a good day? How do you know you had a good day?"".
You should know whether you had a good day, right? And sales is kind of easy. ""Hey, I signed the contract."". We got this job. That's a little bit easier, right? But if you're pushing a lawnmower, how do you know you had a good day?
And I get all kinds of answers. No accidents. Okay. I would grant you that's a good day, right? But it's got to be more than that. And I think that's the big thing we're trying to develop. Knowing your numbers is giving you a scorecard, right?
I can tell you ... What part of the country are you in?
Interviewer
 I'm in Cleveland.
David Amigo
 You're in Cleveland.
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 Okay. So if the Browns win a game on Sunday, right?
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 You feel like you had a good day that day, right?
Interviewer
 Yes.
David Amigo
 Okay. So that's to me what Aspire is. It's our scorecard, right?
Interviewer
 Right.
David Amigo
 And that is what we're trying to develop for each position. We're not there yet, right?
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 We've got a few things figured out but we've got a long way to go. And so, I think that if I can give you a scorecard to tell you whether you had a good day or not, you really can focus in on the things that matter and I think you can have a lot of satisfaction.
And we're working hard ... I have a saying around here, that fits into everything we've been talking around, okay? I want to be accurate. So I want you to know you had a good day and I want to celebrate that. I also want you to know when you had a bad day to encourage you.
You had a bad day. Let's talk about how tomorrow could be a good day. These are the very specific things that you can do to make sure that you have a better day tomorrow. And I think people want to work in an environment where they can get honest feedback, they can grow, they can get better. And they know. They know the rules of the game.
And so that's all a part of treating your team well, right, is not giving them surprises of, ""Well I never know whether I'm doing good or bad. I never know whether they're happy with me or not happy with me."". I think it's being able to communicate that.
Interviewer
 That's great. And once you're able to work out the kinks, do you think you have the tool in Aspire to help you do that or?
David Amigo
 Yes. Yeah I do. I do think that. Now, there's a whole other piece, right? We have to train our managers on how to deliver the news, how to work with people, how to encourage them. I never mind people making mistakes. It's how you respond to them, right?
Did we learn a lesson. Did we get better from it. Or do we just get upset?
Interviewer
 Right.
David Amigo
 And so there's this whole other piece of how to get the information and then work with somebody to get them better.
Interviewer
 Let me ask you this David, do you think that how you feel about the transition from LMN to Aspire, I mean, was it a positive decision? If you were to just answer that a couple sentences, what would you say?
David Amigo
 Am I happy that we switched?
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 Oh yeah. Thrilled.
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm. Can you elaborate on that? I mean would you be able to ... ?
David Amigo
 We get the information we need. My team ... I don't have the pain points. There's no side comments of ""This software sucks."". And this is that. And I can't get this done. And I'm frustrated with that.
No that's all gone away. It's allowed us to all get on the same page. Yeah, no. That part's been excellent.
Interviewer
 Great. And actually that brings my last question. So implementations don't usually take 30 days. What brought on the 30-day implementation and can you just in the next six minutes walk me through why you did it that way? And what the differences were between LMN implementation and Aspire implementation?
David Amigo
 Yeah.
Interviewer
 I guess first, how was LMN implementation versus Aspire? And then we can talk about why you did it in 30 days.
David Amigo
 Yeah I mean ... What's the best way? LMN implementation is like going in the McDonald's drive-through. And Aspire is going ... You said ""Cleveland"". I don't know any really fancy restaurants in Cleveland, so I'll use Ruth's Chris or Capital Grille, okay?
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm.
David Amigo
 So you can go get dinner at McDonald's or you can go to Capital Grille.
Interviewer
 Wow. That's good.
David Amigo
 That's the analogy I'll give you. Yeah implementation with Aspire was very much at a different level of service than the level of service in LMN. I'll leave it at that.
Interviewer
 Okay. Did you feel guided and supported through implementation? I mean, that's a fast implementation. So.
David Amigo
 Yeah and I think we did a lot of pushing. So from my perspective, I know my team. And I know our capabilities. And I will brag and be a little bit, I don't know, I'm not supposed to, but I'll be a little cocky about this, okay?
From an IT perspective and a hard work ... I think there are a lot of landscape companies out there that will be as hard-working as us because I've seen that in the industry. But honestly from a technical computer standpoint, I don't know that there are many companies, including all the big ones, that have the resource that we do.
My IT consultant has been with me ... Because he was with me at my previous company. And I think that's our secret weapon. He was with me for ... It's probably 15, 17 years at this point.
Interviewer
 Mm-hmm. And this is when you were at GC?
David Amigo
 Yeah.
Interviewer
 Okay.
David Amigo
 Yeah. So he worked with me there. I brought him with me here. He came to the Aspire conference. I mean, he's a developer.
Interviewer
 Oh okay.
David Amigo
 So he knows what the developers are doing. I get on conference calls, right? I've done it with Aspire, I've done it with LMN and somebody's telling us something and I'm looking at Chris and Chris is like, ""No that's not true. That takes five minutes to code."". Because he's done it, right? You can snow me but you can't snow him, right?
Interviewer
 Right. Right, right, right. Fair enough.
David Amigo
 Or he'll look at me and the opposite. Go, ""Hey, David, that's a major coding issue. That's not so easy to fix."". So I just think our level of IT competency because of him is off the charts. And then the rest of my team is actually really good and we work really well.
Now I know there are other really solid companies out there that work well and work hard. But I'm up for the challenge. I'll put us up against anybody.
Interviewer
 Fantastic. All right David.
David Amigo
 And some quick philosophy. So I do have a theory, okay? I don't care what the deadline is. There's a certain amount of work that it takes to get implemented, right?
Let's call it a hundred units. Whatever those units are. It takes a hundred units, okay? And you can spread those hundred units out six months, 12 months, or a month. It doesn't really matter, right? You're going to do the same amount of work. It's actually worse when you spread it out.
Because what happens is when you do something and then you don't do it for three weeks, you forget what you did. You wind up redoing it. And we just made sure ... We did the homework. And Stephanie was our implementation manager, and she was great. And I don't know that she took us seriously at first. I know John did not take us-
Interviewer
 About the 30 days?
David Amigo
 Yeah I know John didn't take us seriously.
Interviewer
 Oh I'm sure John didn't take you seriously.
David Amigo
 He's like, ""No! I've been doing this. I've done ... "". He's like, ""I've done thousands of implementations. There's no way you're going to get this stuff done."". And I'm like, ""No we will."", right?
Interviewer
 But you already ... Oh, go ahead.
David Amigo
 We had to do some pushing. Like, ""No we can't meet once a week."". Like we're meeting three to five times a week. We just want it done because my perspective is, the faster we do it. You're just ripping the bandaid off and you're on and you're growing, right?
If the theory is Aspire is so much better for us, why wouldn't you want to be doing it right away and have all the benefit of using it versus stretching it out?
Interviewer
 Right. Yeah. Absolutely. Wow. Yeah. All right. David this has been incredibly eye-opening and insightful. I appreciate your time. I'm going to be asking you for your headshot. And-
David Amigo
 I don't know that I have one. I'll have to figure that one out.
Interviewer
 Okay. And then, I don't know if you have any pictures of your teams at work or using the software. Or, I mean, if you just want to use a great project photo, that works too.
David Amigo
 You got a wonderful picture, if you talk to Deanna, she should have an awesome picture of my maintenance ops manager in the Aspire cowboy hat.
Interviewer
 That is a great photo op and I wonder if we can include it somewhere. I wonder though ... Because this is going to go on the website. And I would love just a team photo or something like that. I don't know what you've got David. I don't know if you need to-
David Amigo
 All right. I'll work on that.
Interviewer
 Cool.
David Amigo
 What's my deadline?
Interviewer
 I don't know a couple of ... Maybe a week or two?
David Amigo
 Okay.
Interviewer
 Yeah.
David Amigo
 Okay.
Interviewer
 Perfect. I really appreciate your time David, thank you so much. I will be in touch with a draft because we're going to collaborate on this and I want to make sure that you're comfortable with the things that we're quoting you on.
David Amigo
 Sure.
Interviewer
 And yeah. This has been great. Really appreciate your time.
David Amigo
 Awesome. All right thank you.
Interviewer
 Take care. Thanks David.
David Amigo
 All right. Yep.
Interviewer
 Bye bye."

 |
 00:00
So soon. Um, but I might just jump in here. Um, yeah. So I guess, uh, we can start with, yeah. What, what is property intelligence and, you know, feel free to tag team this <laugh>. 
Speaker 2
 |
 00:18
Yeah. I, I love when Kurt starts talking about this because he definitely has the, the words for this fuel 
Speaker 1
 |
 00:24
<laugh>. 
Speaker 2
 |
 00:25
Yes. Um, but really what property intelligence aims to do is take all of the possible data about a property and connect it in different ways that give context to the job to be done. Um, Joshua, I don't know if you have anything to add to that. I know Kurt, Kurt can go on about property intelligence for, for a while. 
Speaker 3
 |
 00:54
Yeah. So I think it's, it's yeah. Taking all the proper property data and producing actions, actions, and insights to maximize the profitability of a property. Um, so taking all that data to produce actions and insights. And so, um, that's kind of the core concept. And so what we're looking at with, with our products is starting to, 
 01:19
You know, blending what we do at go all on and land one and gathering that data. Um, cuz we're kind of really in the collection, a little bit of the organizing of that data and then using some leveraging some of the things that aspire does as well in some of that realm, especially around organizing the data, um, and starting to expose some actions and insights, but really taking with the three of our products and, and blending that feature functionality in together to kind of open up a new world of property intelligence that, that, that is that creating those, uh, uh, action insights. So I think we always say, and one of the things Kurt has often is, um, turning data into dollars. So with it, 
Speaker 1
 |
 02:05
I, I think I remember him saying that in, uh, in like probably our first conversation <laugh> yeah. 
Speaker 3
 |
 02:11
Trying to find, uh, I've got some, um, oh yeah, you can keep going. I, I was gonna look at just like a slide deck too, that it has some of that information in it. 
Speaker 1
 |
 02:21
Fantastic. Um, so what pain points can aspires property intelligence solution solve for landscape owners? Um, I guess let's start with go Ilon 
Speaker 2
 |
 02:32
Um, so, so the, are we talking about like, as they stand right now as the individual property intelligence products or where we're looking to go with, 
Speaker 1
 |
 02:46
Uh, let's talk about current state and then we can get into future state kind of in one of these, like, I don't know, question four and five. 
Speaker 2
 |
 02:54
Okay. So go Ilon um, as it stands right now, um, provides that property intelligence to the landscape contractors who need the measurements as their first step to doing anything else in their business. So, you know, you can't estimate correctly without property measurements and you know, there, therefore that carries into, you know, pricing correctly, um, placing a competitive bid, that's also profitable. Um, so you're not like underbidding or overbidding your jobs. Um, and as well as, you know, when it, when you get into the operations aspect of, um, you know, actually carrying out those jobs, um, Golon connects the actual measurement data to that visual site map. Um, so that allows, um, you know, not only the crews who are referencing the map to make sure that they're, you know, performing the right services and the right parts of the property, um, but also for the clients that are receiving those maps to make sure that, you know, all of the stakeholders are aligned and that, you know, the client and the, um, landscape contractors are, you know, on the same page about what work is going to be done. And they can more easily communicate if, you know, if something looks incorrect on the map, then they can easily point that out. Um, and it can be edited in real time, um, to be able to, you know, make sure that everyone understands what's what needs to be done. 
Speaker 1
 |
 04:26
Great. Um, Josh, if you want to chat about land one and, and kind of what the, the major pain points are that, uh, that land one helps solve for users? 
Speaker 3
 |
 04:40
Um, yeah. I mean, I think that the, the biggest thing that like, and especially as we talk about it from, from the prop property intelligence side of things is, uh, one of the, one of the main pain points or there's three kind of different things, the lower productivity, meaning that like they're spending a lot of time looking for the information that they need. Um, uh, and then where they're repeating things over and over again, because they didn't have like a, a single source of truth for it. So they end up repeating the same actions cuz they couldn't maybe find where they wrote down that measurement or where they drew up that mock up for that enhancement that they wanted to do. Maybe they drew it on in their notebook or back of a napkin type type situation. So which creates a lot of other issues in the organization when it comes to collaborating with the team, handing off, uh, stuff from estimating to production. 
 05:33
Uh, so they have smooth handoffs from how they estimated and plan the job to how they actually end up doing it in the field. Um, and so yeah, Woodland, one, what we're doing is providing, providing a place, a single source place to do that, connecting a lot of those things cause you don't have use, use multiple applications to do that, but come into one application to, to, to gather that data it's all saved there on the cloud. So there's one place to access it. Um, you can do it quickly and efficiently. Um, so that there, uh, things like the, the manual method of measuring took took would take hours to do. And so in either one of our products coil on or land one, you can do that in, uh, in a matter of minutes instead of hours, sometimes especially saving when you start talking about saving trips to a job site with it. 
 06:22
So, um, and then just, yeah, the other particular pain point around that is the time that it takes to, to sell work, um, by, by having that time savings, then users can, uh, uh, sell quickly cuz they can go in, get, get the, get the data, they need turn that data into an estimate quickly. Um, and especially now that, uh, now that we're, we've rolled out, you know, I think sometime next month or not next month, sometime later this month it'll be generally available for all the, uh, aspire users. But the second phase of the integration with aspire and integrating on the estimate and opportunity level, um, is just made that even faster. So now they can pretty much, now they can instantly measure or design and go out on and land one and instantly produce and, and estimate and a price for an opportunity with inspire. Um, that's a immediate instant process. So that's a huge time savings and a, a big pain point solver for especially aspire customers. 
Speaker 1
 |
 07:26
Uh, that actually kind of goes into this next question. So wait, um, current state just so I can wrap my brain around and communicate it accurately, how are these? And, and we'll start with go island. Um, and, and, and I'm like kind of starting in this order because I think of yeah, like the measuring and then the, yeah, like the design and the takeoff piece is kind of like the next part of it. Um, part of the process, but the, yeah. Uh, how, how does go Ilon uh, work with aspire currently? Uh, so, so like current users of both like, um, how, yeah. How do they work? 
Speaker 2
 |
 08:14
Yeah. So, um, a user of both platforms, um, they start in aspire, um, on a new help me with this. Uh, if you can, Joshua or Abby, um, opportunity, mm-hmm, <affirmative> a new prop, a new property property, new property, um, and open up go island from aspire. Um, and so what that does is it searches the user's Golon database to see if that project already exists, if it does, it'll prompt them to, you know, open up that existing, um, go island project, um, or to create a new one. Uh, and then from there, um, all of their 
 09:06
Mappings that they had set up when the, in, when they first initiated the integration, um, for things such as like their services materials, um, are loaded into the project, the Golon project. Um, so they have a template for, um, you know, the different like measuring groups and services that they'll be planning for and measuring for. Um, and then, you know, when they're completing, when they've completed their Golon, um, site map, then with the click of a button that sends back over to aspire. And so all of that, um, data that they just created all essentially like all of the property intelligence data that they just gathered, um, is added straight back into aspire. 
Speaker 1
 |
 09:52
Okay, great. Um, and then the, um, the integration moving forward. Hi, Kurt <laugh> 
Speaker 4
 |
 10:02
Abby, my total apologies for being so late. I totally had to respond to something I got pulled off and, uh, hopefully I didn't hold things up, but I'll be quiet. You go ahead. And my 
Speaker 1
 |
 10:14
Apologies <laugh>, uh, Kelsey was just really me and on, um, uh, how the, how go island, uh, works with aspire currently. And then we'll talk about, or I was just about to ask, like, so what is, what is the forward looking future state of how the two solutions will work together? I mean, I imagine that it'll be completely integrated within aspire, um, eventually, but yeah, what's the, what's the plan. 
Speaker 4
 |
 10:45
So let's, um, I'm, I'm wondering if maybe I should show, um, on the second tier, well, I'll tell you what, before I do that, we'll talk about the plan. So let, let, let's just give the, the big overview, you know, um, what's being worked on now is the property intelligence platform or our product. So a standalone solution that, uh, at first release is going to take the features of Golon and land one and combine them along with some additional, uh, new technologies for reporting and job optimizations. And eventually the line of land one will be retired and everyone will move to that new platform. And that will be the future of, uh, both systems and a property intelligence. Um, so the goal is to continuously add new features and iterate on that, um, with the goal of, uh, allowing customers to, uh, collect, connect and visualize data in every aspect of their business. So, um, I'm gonna have to dig up this presentation here, which might make some sense here. Hang on just a second and I will add, but Josh, do you want to add anything to that in the, in the meantime? 
Speaker 1
 |
 12:13
Yeah. Josh let's chat about, uh, I mean, 
Speaker 3
 |
 12:16
Yeah, I don't know that I would write that in this blog piece, if you've got a blog piece in, in a media, uh, I wouldn't mention about products getting retired. Uh, oh, no. Some of this, yeah. Some of this would be at ignite trying to, uh, started start to debut some of this, but, uh, but yeah, I mean, that's kind of right now, like current state, both our products there there's integrations on property takeoff and, and opportunity as, so those are the two integration points. So we, our, our two products talk to each other to aspire in the property, takeoff and opportunity estimate areas. 
 12:57
Okay. So, gotcha. Does that make sense? I think so it's kind of the hierarchy and aspire. You have properties, right? Mm-hmm <affirmative> okay. And then within properties you have opportunities, right. So then, so basically there's two different, there's two spots on both of those. So on the property level, it's on the takeoff mm-hmm <affirmative> and on the opportunity it's at the estimate. Got it. So, so you can send data from either one of our systems to those two, two locations. So that's kind of that right. There is the, well, we, that would, I would describe that as the current state of things in both of 'em and then yeah, as Kurt started mentioning and teasing out, the future state is more tightly weaving. The three of our products together into eventually you'll have two products, you'll have aspire and you'll property intelligence and property and they'll, and then those two will be seamlessly integrated with each other to kind of handle the optimizing of the business along sales and production and estimating areas. 
Speaker 1
 |
 13:56
Okay. 
Speaker 4
 |
 13:58
And I'm sorry, because I just jumped in and started rambling, but I need to ask you, what are you writing about what is focus of this piece here? I's help understand exactly what you're for, then, then we can messaging. 
Speaker 1
 |
 14:18
So this is basically to kind of like socialize this property intelligence, uh, term, um, to aspire current users and, uh, prospects. So it's like, all right, we're, we're gonna refer to go island and, um, land one as property intelligence tools. Like what does that even mean, um, to aspire? Like what do these solutions do? And, um, if I'm a user, I want to know like how they actually work within the system. Um, like, are they actually integrated? Is it kind of more of like a sinking between these two until they become more integrated? Um, and then also, yeah, just like trying to communicate what property intelligence means to aspire, um, the pain points, the, the, the challenges that, uh, these solutions help landscapers overcome, and then, you know, hopefully, uh, where I can sort of like maybe tease, uh, future, um, or, um, integrations or just like things or, or details about property intelligence that users would maybe get excited about. Does that make sense? Got it. 
 15:39
Yes. That sounds like a lot, but I mean, really, it, it it's, it's just to kind of like, I think that when both of these solutions came on board for aspire was, you know, we did the, the, the article for Golon and we did a Q and a, uh, with Josh, and then now it's kind of like, okay, well, now that, uh, you know, we're, we've, we've had some time to, um, you know, integrate or, you know, kind of plan the future of these two solutions with aspire. Where, where are we now? Where are we going? Does that make sense? 
Speaker 4
 |
 16:16
It does. It does. And, and, you know, on, on the one hand we want to, um, also be very careful too, when we communicate that it's more general and I know, 
Speaker 1
 |
 16:25
Oh yeah. I mean, you guys will definitely be able to review this cause I wanna make sure I'm, I'm getting everything accurate. And then if yeah, so, 
Speaker 4
 |
 16:35
Okay. My recording, and then what's your, what's your timing? What's your timing for this having? 
Speaker 1
 |
 16:40
Oh, so, I mean, there's no real timeline for this. If, if I don't end up writing this, I might just pass this recording onto, um, our agency red pen to write it, but probably, I mean, I'd like to get this out in the next couple of weeks. 
Speaker 4
 |
 16:55
Okay. Yeah. So it's actually really interesting timing because we, we just had a decision yesterday and Kelsey shared that with you today, which, you know, impacts you. And obviously Jeff's known about it for a while, but, um, I'm gonna share my screen here on something that we're gonna be doing at night that, that plays into this and I think will help, um, grab here. Okay. Um, so are you able to see this slide deck mm-hmm <affirmative> should say, okay. So first of all, um, just the, the product vision for, you know, property intelligence and just breaking it down. Um, and then I'll use that to segue into a couple other things. Um, you know, we're starting with landscaping, but it's really designed to help all field service companies. And there's a lot being said in a little here. So this seamless collecting, connecting, and visualizing essential data and that essential data, I mean, that's property intelligence. 
 17:54
So it might be in the form of square foot square footage. It might be depth. It might be a material. It might be account. It might be proximity to other things on a map, um, all those different types of data, um, showing up connected. Okay. Cause first we have to grab that data and then we have to connect it to something. So, you know, you've seen the go on and then one, the visual component of it, it's not just a measurement, the number, but it's also where the measurement is, what the measurement pertains to the materials associated with the measurement. Who's doing the work, what type of equipment they will use to perform the service with the material. So there's a lot of different things coming together here. So it's about collecting it, getting the information, then connecting it one piece of data to another, but also visualizing it. 
 18:45
Um, and then the outcome is both on the sales side, all right, helping them to estimate price, win the work and then service it more efficiently and effectively. Um, so every aspect of their business. So I just wanted to share this kind of, this is our, our north star, if you will, in terms of, um, what the property intelligence product will do now, in today's terms, we've got Golon, which produces some of that property intelligence data. And then we also have land one which produces some of that property intelligence data, um, land one does enhancements land, one does design built. So you're able to grab data on top of plans on top of other data that go island does not provide and see it visually and still have that spacial recognition and apply materials in time, um, to, to those types of work. So what we are going to be doing here and will be announcing it at night at night is the property intelligence bundle. 
 19:47
So in essence, property intelligence already exists. It's inside go island and land one, and you can buy that, uh, at a special price and both systems will integrate with aspire. The ultimate vision then is to consolidate those into a platform, uh, that seamlessly takes the functionality. So that's where we're headed next year. But this year we're gonna actually start selling property intelligence as a bundle, uh, cuz you've got the property intelligence on contributes and land one contributes and then aspire takes it even further. All right. Cause when we, we go back to here and we say, we need to collect yep. Connect and visualize the essential data, aspire software takes the data and does amazing things with it, but they're not able to collect it. Yeah. So we're producing, we're also helping connect and visualize, but then aspire even takes it further with all of their capabilities and applies that data to different functions within the organization. We don't even touch. Um, so just wanted to point that out that it will exist here coming up very, very soon in concept. And so the same factors about collecting, connecting, and visualizing, um, you know, to be able to take action, uh, to win sales or to service properties are already there. 
Speaker 1
 |
 21:14
Can I use that messaging in this blog, post Perth, the collecting, connecting and visualizing cuz I mean, I, I think that'll really kind of crystallize it for people that like that aspire takes all of these, this great information from the estimate on, but that these two solutions really kind of like create the basis for creating a good estimate. 
Speaker 4
 |
 21:36
Yes. I would say that will be no problem with that said we will take a look at the, um, you know, the final product, but yes. Right. That's the vision statement I think will go a long way and then you'll be able to write, I mean, each one of those, uh, pieces in here. Yeah. You can oops. Um, showcase down, you know, how do we collect it? You know? Well, we use different tools. We use aerial imagery and we use all these other things. So you'll have a lot of material that's contained, um, in this. Um, yeah, definitely. Then the other thing I wanted to mention is we're actually in a meeting, um, Thursday, uh, with marketing to talk about the messaging for this. Okay. I just sprung this. We just sprung this on everyone, uh, today, because the decision was only green lighted by the exec team yesterday. Okay. This was, we were actually, we were gonna go, okay, so this is brand new and we're just starting to trickle it out. So from Kelsey's standpoint is marketing. You know, one of the things we're gonna need to work on is messaging around this bundle and it's awesome. It's a perfect interim step for what we need to do anyway for selling property intelligence. Cause it's the same language, the same concepts, the same ideas. They're just in separate systems packaged together, but we'll eventually come together. So 
Speaker 1
 |
 22:52
This is all gonna be unveiled at ignite, correct? 
Speaker 4
 |
 22:56
Correct. Okay. 
Speaker 1
 |
 22:57
But I, um, but this is not something that I should be discussing right now, so correct. 
Speaker 4
 |
 23:03
Not, not right now. 
Speaker 1
 |
 23:05
I wonder, 
Speaker 4
 |
 23:08
No, go ahead. 
Speaker 1
 |
 23:09
Um, I was gonna say like, I, I mean, I wonder if I can kind of tease, there will be a property intelligence, um, you know, whatever release information, some, some, something about property intelligence at ignite. 
Speaker 4
 |
 23:27
I think you will be able to do that. And we just wanna make sure that we have everyone's check off. Um, you know, here I would've rambled on and given you like the whole nine yards that Zach would've, uh, a suggestion wouldn't have stopped me there. Um, you know, no. Yeah. Why, why not problem intelligence? But no, we, we do, um, need to be, uh, aware that this is for internal use only right now mm-hmm <affirmative> and as we lock it down and as we're building it out, we will definitely be able to give you more content. But I would say starting off yes. The vision statement and everything contained within that, um, our bundle and then I have a feeling we're gonna get to the exact language, but how we're going to then tease the property intelligence product. Um, so this new tech, which is gonna be vague, but people are gonna know that this is gonna convert into this because we're providing them a special bonus when this happens to move over into the platform. 
Speaker 1
 |
 24:23
Oh wow. 
Speaker 4
 |
 24:25
So backward compatibility, you know, we don't want people to stop using Golon or land one mm-hmm <affirmative>, you know, right now we brought, we want to give them confidence that they can buy our products here and that they're gonna work in the next generation, which is a consolidated platform. And that in itself is a huge value. I mean, obviously you have to just go online for some things and you gotta jump into to land one. Um, and it's, you know, uh, another step once you put those things together and you're able to see that data interact seamlessly, that is gonna be huge. So, uh, and then I would say right now too, you've got some opportunities. It might be able to leverage for content with our joint customers in terms of how they're using go Ilon and land one already. 
Speaker 1
 |
 25:13
Yeah. That would be great. I mean, if there's, if, if, if you guys had a source that I could talk to for this, I mean, that would be phenomenal just to kind of, you know, give some, like, I don't know, a couple testimonial soundbites for how it's working for them. 
Speaker 4
 |
 25:28
Partly we're gonna have to buy mark and my escape steak dinner or something. Oh 
Speaker 1
 |
 25:34
My gosh. I mean, I've, I've, I've already talked to Chris Kline in virus, escapees, but uh, is this, uh, I, I mean, yeah, I think it's in virus escapes. 
Speaker 4
 |
 25:46
They, they use both systems, right? 
Speaker 3
 |
 25:47
They use both. Yeah. Chris. Yeah. Chris is at virus escapes. 
Speaker 1
 |
 25:50
Yeah. 
Speaker 4
 |
 25:52
So there you go. There's one. Okay. 
Speaker 1
 |
 25:55
Who, um, who who's the main contact there? 
Speaker 4
 |
 25:59
Um, just, yeah, remind me, Mike May Mike. 
Speaker 3
 |
 26:03
Mike May. Yeah. And, and Chris to both. Yeah. Chris, Chris uses lane one and then Mike gets primarily using, uh Golon. 
Speaker 1
 |
 26:13
Okay. Yeah. I'm gonna need to <laugh> I'm I'm gonna re regroup with Chris because I actually talked with him. Uh, actually I talked with him yeah. For land land one, I think now wait, now I can't remember. It's been so long and I need to wrap up that 
Speaker 3
 |
 26:30
Case and we, and we might can get some different, you know, some, somebody else for you. So I can kind of go back and look at the list of who's been using some of the current integration stuff. Mm-hmm <affirmative> and I can get, get you produce somebody if you need some fresh, 
Speaker 1
 |
 26:43
A fresh face. Yeah. That'd be great. 
Speaker 4
 |
 26:48
Um, so, and I think that's a great example, you know, we haven't sold it as a bundle yet, but they've bundled it on their own. And so you're getting the, the, you know, obviously the benefits, the perspective, and we would love for any communications. You have to be picked up and indirectly sell the property intelligence bundle, uh, because you know, one of our goals is to move as much, go on and land one, uh, product as we can, um, because that's gonna only presale property intelligence and it's gonna be a very smooth transition. 
Speaker 1
 |
 27:21
Okay. 
Speaker 4
 |
 27:23
And then I wanted to mention too, we'll be working on a graphic. Um, you know, this is very, very basic, but we're gonna be working on a graphic that goes in detail, and we'll be talking about this more in the marketing meeting of how go out on and land one systems generate the property intelligence. These companies need to win. It'll be great now. And again, you know, you've got the measurements, the aerial imagery, you've got design build, you've got, uh, enhancements. And, you know, it's not about winning a job, but then maximizing your profitability on that job through upsells, through long term relationships, through, uh, lifetime value of the customer. And so these two systems coming together, um, you know, again, create that property intelligence impact. 
Speaker 1
 |
 28:10
Awesome. I think, uh, so the more, I'm kind of understanding about where this is going and kind of the, the timeline and the decisions that need to be made before we, you know, start talking about sort of future state and future messaging for the property intelligence bundle and property intelligence platform. Like, it really just seems like I'm gonna kind of set aside all the future state stuff and really kind of focus on, you know, this is what property intelligence does, so collects, connects, and visualizes. Um, if there's anything else like, um, if there's anything else that we should kind of discuss about like pain points that these solutions, um, or that these pain, the pain points that these solutions, um, help, uh, users solve. I mean, we can go more into that, but maybe I'll just kind of set aside the, all of this future stuff, just because I don't wanna kind of step on any, uh, sure. Future messaging. So, 
Speaker 4
 |
 29:24
And, and you know, all of it is valid and we have messaging for both, um, land one and Golon, mm-hmm, <affirmative>, um, product positioning as well as message points that you can draw from, and that are all true and live today. And what we're saying is, you know, one plus one equals three or even more, when you have one of these systems, you gain all those advantages. When you combine the two systems together, right now, you have got more than just each individual benefit. You've got that combined benefit and a streamlined and standardized process. That's the other thing is a lot of these companies are, you know, guesstimating or they're, they're using these fragmented processes. Well, we are these two systems, even though they're separate, bring them so much standardization, uh, here's how we do it here, methodology that makes them more accurate and also more professional in, in what they're doing rather than using just a spreadsheet or, uh, you know, sticking their thumb up and guessing mm-hmm <affirmative>. 
 30:30
Um, and then, you know, like from, from go out on, you're able to share view and see interactive output of these, of the property intelligence. It brings the property intelligence to life, right there. You can scroll around, see it, change it, same with land one on the plants. You can put different plants into it. You can see it from different perspectives. Here's the future we're selling you something we haven't built yet, you know? Um, and so you can tangibleize it. And that's where that visualization component comes in. We wanna make this real because these service businesses are just selling promises. Yeah. We'll show up three days from now or three months from now and do something, but you can't hold anything in your hand, you're just buying a promise. And so our systems actually make those promises visible. You know, here's what it looks like, oh, it's on my property. 
 31:17
Oh yeah. Here's what these plans will come to life has. Um, and that's a very important part of the buying processes is tangibleize it, um, for the, for the customer. So anyway, going off in a lot of different directions here, but I think you've a lot of different parts to work with. And then, you know, you can draw from the messaging of both mm-hmm <affirmative>, um, but just that bundle and, you know, I'm really curious to see too how you would write it up or someone else, because you're used to buying bundles, you know, um, we, we all do it. Uh, you go to the grocery store and you buy shampoo and it'll come with some conditioner okay. Extra or whatever, or a comb, or, you know, I don't know what, but it's like, okay, wait a minute. I get it. I'm saving money. Or I'm getting additional things I would need because I'm using this product. I need a cone, you know, come on. So bundling it together, um, tells a bigger story and it adds more value. And so that's what we wanna do with this. Um, you know, cuz again, you can jump in right now and buy these products separately. 
Speaker 1
 |
 32:27
Awesome. All right. Okay. Kurt, I think that I've, I think that I'm, especially since I, I can still use the current yeah. Positioning and messaging docs that are in that are, um, on Google drive. Right. Kelsey, I'm just gonna continue with you. Like what are the most, uh, recent ones cuz I mean I'm, I'm, I'm seeing a couple in the solutions folder and I, I'm not quite sure. Yes. I will get this to you. Yeah. Um, but that all makes sense if I can use those positioning docs and, and kind of take what we've discussed today and, and um, you know, maybe tease that there's, uh, you know, announcements coming ignite. I think that that'll be an interesting way to kind of wrap this up and, and at least start talking about property intelligence as a concept to aspire. Um, can you share this doc with me? This deck with me? Um, Kurt, I won't do anything with it. 
Speaker 4
 |
 33:31
I would have to defer to Josh on that so he can take the blame and he can pro me back again. I'd give you anything, Abby. I just send it all in your way and then be like, what, um, you know what, um, we'll we'll check. 
Speaker 3
 |
 33:42
Well, I, I just it's, it's about set, setting realistic expectations. So we don't wanna get in, 
 33:48
We don't want to set an expectation for too much too soon. And so fair enough. Um, I think the, the, the, the current expectation is, is like he saying, I mean, getting everything a we're bundling every, you know, we're gonna eventually we'll have this kind of ability to buy both at a, at a bundle price, but then we're bundling everything to a, it all, eventually all become, uh, a consolidated application and then, you know, one, one product. Um, and then, but then once we have that, now we have the framework for adding in all these new features that it starts to mention there in phase two. So, um, so that's kind of like, yeah, I mean, this is what we're, this is what we're saying. So that's the expectations we're trying to set. Right. Um, I don't know where we are. I, I would say we don't need to throw a blog out there before ignite talking. 
Speaker 1
 |
 34:46
Oh, no, 
Speaker 3
 |
 34:46
No, no. Talking about the new product. So, but after ignite, I think it's fair game, you know? Yeah. 
Speaker 1
 |
 34:52
To start, 
Speaker 3
 |
 34:53
Start hing up. 
Speaker 1
 |
 34:55
So I'm definitely not trying to step on the, um, ignite announcement. I, I, I was just kind of curious for all the, uh, the property intelligence, like the early part of the deck and, and kind of how we're 
Speaker 3
 |
 35:08
Yeah. I would use that. I would start that vision statement if we can start, you know, weaving that in and out. Um, for, for that, uh, guy, actually, when you were asking at the beginning, I forgot we had, uh, crafted this into a more, uh, more singular statement there. So, but, um, I think, yeah, that condenses it. Um, and if you wanna alter it now, instead of saying field service companies, you can say landscapers, you know, landscape or however you want to, you can change that out to whatever you want to contextually change that out to. Um, I think we went back and forth on how do we get an all-encompassing term there to not shut out future market, uh, with this tool, cuz this tool could end up being used beyond just landscape and irrigators. 
Speaker 1
 |
 35:56
So right. I, I, I have a feeling that all like the vast majority of our website content and yeah. Like, unless it's out there for a specific reason for SEO or what have you, I think a lot of this will be sort of industry agnostic. I think you'll see a lot more field service companies as a term rather than landscape or janitorial or whatever verticals we have moving forward, just cuz you know, we're trying to, trying to get everybody in here. <laugh> mm-hmm <affirmative> um, okay, well this is all really helpful. Um, let's see. Is there anything else that's useful in this deck besides this product vision statement? 
Speaker 4
 |
 36:37
No. What, what we're doing is we're going through and we're looking at some pricing scenarios because that's one of our next steps with property intelligence is to zero in on pricing. And so, um, I've been doing, um, a lot of work on, on pricing pieces for the product we're hiring, uh, a company, um, to come in and do research, um, to further inform the pricing. So a lot of it is just some, some bookends, for instance, we showed you this where, Hey, we're, we're going off, which you can buy it now. So you can compare then doing a discount, but we've got then the tiers for the new product. Okay. And helping don't be screenshoting this Sam <laugh>. 
 37:16
But um, you know, again, we, we are looking at how can we communicate the pricing of the new product in a way that, uh, gives existing customers of go out on and man one, um, some legacy preferred status to switch over into the new system. Um, and so, you know, we're, we're looking here at doing a legacy bonus where we would provide them some additional, uh, value, um, you know, in terms of users or projects or other things when they move over into the new system, but they can only qualify for that if they use go out on or land one. And now this bundle, um, you know, and, and the goal is to not have anyone wait to start using these services or to be afraid that, oh, I'm gonna lose something. Um, and a lot of it is, you know, different features, um, coming through in terms of what those tiers would provide in property intelligence. 
 38:10
Okay. So that gets a lot more granular. And again, these are starting points okay. For, for different things. Um, that you'd see, but these are very much works in progress. I would show you the whole property intelligence vision deck, but actually I think I'd be doing you a disservice because if we open you to all these things that are potentially coming and, and very loose, that's gonna distract you from the bundle, which I think is really the key here. We already have property intelligence, you know, active that you could buy and taking that step to use those systems, tee you up for something even better in the future. Um, you know, and, and with the integration, you know, it's huge. So we wanna make sure that, you know, we keep you zeroed in and do in, and don't buy Aku, um, because it gets outta control pretty fast. 
 39:00
<laugh> this is gonna be a big product and there's a lot of, lot different things going on. So, you know, we could peel back the onion, but you might, you know, once you, once you look in, uh, that might be it. So, um, no, but I, I think for, for now the product vision is, is Josh was saying is a great place to start. We can read into it and, um, you know, modify it and then we're gonna be providing you some more things too, because we're gonna be on a fast track, uh, messaging for this bundle. Um, I mean, ignites coming up. And so we really have to think through some things and that would include, you know, pricing, but also a graphic that is gonna show you the property intelligence flow now between the two systems. All right. So, okay, well what, why do I need this bundle? Well, wait a minute. Here's what happens with a property that you, you know, just measured and bid in one on now you take that property and you do even more. Okay. Um, so we, we're gonna be visually breaking that out to try and get everyone on the same page as to the value that this bundle is unlocking and how property intelligence is flowing through these two systems. 
Speaker 1
 |
 40:08
Awesome. So, 
Speaker 4
 |
 40:10
Andrew, 
Speaker 1
 |
 40:12
Um, I'll talk about, yeah. These, these solutions that, uh, that vision statement, um, just to clarify the bundle is not even something that we're introducing before ignite. So I shouldn't reference that as like a friend, 
Speaker 4
 |
 40:31
We still have some work to do. I mean, theoretically, you could jump on right now, like buy, buy. 'em both, you know, we're, we're doing a secret, I'm less concerned about, you know, oh, they're gonna be bundling the two products that might be no big deal. Um, you know, and obviously people always appreciate getting a better value when they buy two together. Um, I would say we're gonna probably have some information on that for you pretty soon. 
Speaker 1
 |
 40:58
Okay. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's possible that, um, yeah, that, that information might even come out before I'm able to talk to somebody who uses both of these two solutions, which I'd love to do for this blog post. Um, but yeah, if, if I guess the next step is like, kind of after I process all this and kind of get the, the bones of what I want this post to look like, I'd, I I'd love to talk to one or two people who currently use both solutions, if that is a possibility. 
Speaker 4
 |
 41:35
Yes. So we've got the escapes guys. Um, Josh, do you know of any other joint customers that are using those systems? 
Speaker 3
 |
 41:44
Um, yeah. There's, uh, I think there's, um, 
Speaker 1
 |
 42:02
I don't mean to put you on the spot, 
Speaker 3
 |
 42:03
Josh. No, I, I just gotta get, I gotta log into, uh, buried 
Speaker 4
 |
 42:07
In there, buried in there somewhere. 
Speaker 3
 |
 42:09
Yeah. I have to log into, uh, um, 
Speaker 4
 |
 42:13
Well, at least we know there's more than one hope, so 
Speaker 3
 |
 42:15
That's good. Yeah. There there's, there's a report actually on it in HubSpot. Um, I, uh, but I can, but there is, I can send you potentially that link too, cuz I'm sure you, you have a HubSpot account or I do login, so I should be able to, you should able to view that, um, 
Speaker 1
 |
 42:36
That works, 
Speaker 3
 |
 42:37
But yeah, I mean there's, uh, looks like there's 20. Oh, great. Right now. So, um, I, 
Speaker 4
 |
 42:50
I do want to caveat this Abby, just in terms of thinking through this, these are people who have bought our systems separately, not as a bundle. Right. Okay. So when you're just, I would just talk about the, how they're using both systems. We haven't really had this conversation, you know, in terms of oh yeah. You know, we, we were talking about what these discounts should be and they could be up to 50%. Yeah. Okay. Depending there's a lot of other factors. And if we announce that and you know, we've got 25 customers that have paid full price for these systems that could create a little tension. And so we're gonna figure this out and, and, you know, take care of everybody. But we, again, just greenlighted this yesterday. So I just wanted to raise that sense. 
Speaker 1
 |
 43:45
I will not discuss anything, uh, specific about pricing or yeah, this is, this is more like how, yeah. What is your experience using these, these two solutions as well as aspire and, and, and how they helped you, you know, achieve your business goals or, you know, what, what are the main challenges you're facing? How, um, yeah, how's go island and how's land one, um, yeah. Helping you over, overcome those challenges and, and what has it, what has it meant or what has it, how, how has it changed your experience of the systems as they've been, uh, kind of integrated with aspire or, you know, something like that? It, it will, I will not go on any specifics like those. 
Speaker 4
 |
 44:37
Okay. Yeah. And 
Speaker 3
 |
 44:38
That, that link I just sent you, not every single one of those are actually aspire users. Those are just, it's not a three way, uh, kind of got it. It, all, those are just common between us and go aisle on. So you'd have to kind of back check to find out, 
Speaker 1
 |
 44:55
Got it. 
Speaker 3
 |
 44:56
Who there might be also an aspire user. 
Speaker 1
 |
 45:00
Got it. Yeah. I think that, yeah, it looks like they're. Yeah. Cuz I can see yeah. That some people are not <laugh> users inspire, so yeah, this is, this is helpful. And thank you for pointing that out, Josh, 
Speaker 4
 |
 45:19
And one other tip, I'd give you when you're connecting with these people, they, um, aren't necessarily using the word property intelligence. Right. 
Speaker 1
 |
 45:30
I's kinda the point of this blog part. 
Speaker 4
 |
 45:32
Yeah. Yeah. And, and I think though that, that if you're presenting it, like for instance, you're talking about, okay, so how are you using your go on property intelligence or your land one property. If you serve it to them, it's gonna be a very comfortable community. Oh yeah. We use it, you know that, but they're just not using the proper term if you will. Mm-hmm <affirmative> um, consciously. So I think one of the opportunities we have is to help them start using that. And I just wanted to point out that if you do kind of load up your questions and by append property intelligence, you know, to the output, you know, they're used to saying, oh my measurements, my output, my, you know, this, that and other well, we're trying to train them a little bit in terms of, no, this is property intelligence and you're looking at it in isolation, but when you connect it and you visualize it, it's a lot more than that. And they kind of understand it because they use our products, but they don't call it that. 
Speaker 1
 |
 46:24
Right. Got it. Yeah. That makes sense. 
Speaker 4
 |
 46:29
So just there 
Speaker 1
 |
 46:32
The pilot test interview to socialize property intelligence <laugh> 
Speaker 4
 |
 46:36
There you go. You can train them. Yeah. 
Speaker 1
 |
 46:40
Okay. Well, I, I really appreciate your time guys. I'll uh, I'll, I'll look through the messaging. I'll I'll kind of synthesize what, uh, I mean, you guys have dropped a lot of info on me here as far as future state, but, but I don't want that to like muddy the waters of what we're talking about right here. Um, which is yeah. This, this vision statement and how to communicate that to current users and prospects. Um, okay, great. Well, thank you all, really, really appreciate your time. And uh, I will be in touch with a draft as, as soon as I can figure out whether or not I'm gonna write it or I'm gonna give this to red pen. There's like too many things going on at the moment. Um, but I really wanna make sure that we get this right. Cause it's important. 
Speaker 4
 |
 47:29
Sounds good. All right. Well thanks. And you know where to find us if you need anything and forward to check out. 
Speaker 1
 |
 47:35
All right. Thanks guys. Thanks Gabby. 
Speaker 4
 |
 47:38
Thank you. Have a good one. See ya."
